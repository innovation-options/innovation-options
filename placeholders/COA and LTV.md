## 1 Page Business Plan

Business models can take many forms: subscription, transactions, multi-sided -- the range of possibility is truly limitless. 

However, in the final analysis, every model must satisfy the following equation to be successful:  

COA < LTV

Or, the Cost of Acquisition must be less than the Life Time Value of every unit acquired.  It's as simple as that.

Now we can dress this up in very complex and complicated ways, but ultimately if you can't make this equation work then you don't have a sustainable business. 


The simplest form of this is the transactional, one-time customer:  if there is no repeat business then the unit must be sold for less that the cost to produce the unit.  

But when consider 

Typically, COA is calculated solely as a function of direct acquisition (i.e., short-term marginal costs directly associated with marketing/promotion.)  However, this model takes a more holistic view, and you should include all cash outlays as part of the acquisition costs.

This might seem counter-intuitive: why should some fixed-cost G&A component such as rent — which has nothing directly to do with marketing — be considered as part of the marginal acquisition cost?  The simplest response is the principle that in the long run, all costs are variable.  And since the entire innovation project will live or die based on the COA/LTV equation, the project is entirely long-run focused. Moreover, if rent is required to produce a product and house a marketing team, then that clearly contributes to the overall acquisition strategy.  In most cases G&A will (or at least should) be minimized, so this provides an added incentive to do so.

Furthermore, as we’ll see a bit later, having a simple COA metric will provide an easy way to determine funding needs moving forward as a total cash outlay on a per-acquisition basis.  

I should emphasize that this is all based on cash.  Non-cash expenses like depreciation should not be considered as part of the COA calculation.  

When calculating the COA, you must use consistent, time-based cohorts.  The precise interval selected will depend on a variety of factors, including the sales and fulfillment cycle of the product itself.  However, you should at least choose a period of time that smooths out any localized variability.  For instance, selecting a two-week period may produce an oscillating COA simply because the underlying billing cycle is monthly.  In cases like this you can take the easy path and move to a monthly COA cohort, or you could mathematically split the monthly costs into semi-monthly intervals.  

There will be other corner cases, of course, such as pre-paid expenses (insurance policies that are expensed monthly but paid annually, and so on.  The main point here is to work out a consistent basis that will give you the direction you need.  Accounting tricks are always possible, but they will distort your needs and ultimately fool no one.  Do what you can to keep things as simple as possible.

If you don’t know where to begin, start by simply tracking two COA calculations:  the total (all money spend divided by all acquisitions) and a monthly COA (total monthly cash out divided by acquisitions that month.)  Yes, you can play games with any given month, but overall the trend should be clear.
