# Growth Engine

Placeholder for the COA focused approach to measuring growth.

Basically, if the goal is non-linear growth (which is the whole point of innovation per the three horizons model) we can measure it as-is.  However, if we include the actual cash basis for COA then we get the inverse of the growth curve measured in dollars.  Ultimately this is what we seek.  Use the extreme example of Yo in why this is important, and in particular with the immediate goal of moving from innovation to growth horizon.  

The concern is that COA iin an innovation accounting context is different than in a normal horizon one business — so how to differentiate the two?  Perhaps a different name.  

But the core concept here is that we’re measuring COA with regard to pure cash flow without the normal application of fixed cost amortization, etc,   This comes down to a “in the long run all costs are marginal” and understanding that if the enterprise never makes it to the next stage then that’s as long -run as it gets.
