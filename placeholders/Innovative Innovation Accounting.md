# What makes innovation accounting innovative

Innovation Accounting: traditional zero:  because we are only considering the growth that comes from our assumptions.  It is what paid for the party.  

New valuation approach: options.  This is what increases the opportunity for the firm, at lower risk.

Characteristics of options:  low cost, time-bound, decision focused, set price.  


<!-- Speed and Accuracy; Innovation Accounting as a Meta concept -->

<!-- exploration v. Execution:  no brand, no money, no partners, no problem -->


And so this gives us the full view of the lifecycle from the two accounting approaches, the ultimate goals remain the same: Growth Engine, followed by Profit Engine.  But the pre-growth stages — the ones that happen when the Growth and Profit are effectively zero — are very different.  Remember, in the traditional approach the Development Stage is used to prepare the product for market, and the Introduction stage is to launch that product.  Now both of these actions assume that non-linear growth will result from those efforts — it’s fully baked into the funding mechanism.  The only reason to do the development and launch is because it’s going to grow.  Otherwise what is the point?

In contrast, the lean startup approach does not make the assumption that the product will follow the original development and launch plan — or even that it’s guaranteed to grow at all.  Instead, it says “here are the assumptions that we have.  If things go as we expect, then we’ll grow.  And if they don’t, then we’ll pivot to another approach based on what we’ve learned”.   The focus is clearly on the learning involved.

The lean startup approach simply says “let’s test the idea itself”  — which doesn’t require a fully baked product.  Instead, we produce low-fidelity representations of the idea searching for the validated learning required to move on to the next stage.   So the Development stage is really the Idea stage, which is how we’re going to refer to it moving forward.

Similarly, the Introduction phase does not simply represent the start of the growth phase; instead, it is to provide options to the firm.  Specifically, this means products that have been tested in the market, and have demonstrated validated growth opportunities.  Thus, we’re again renaming the stage to reflect the optionality it provides, or the Option stage.

So this is what the final stages look like, an how we’ll be referring to them from now one:  the idea stage, moving to the option stage, moving to the growth stage, and finally the profit stage. 





We’re going to get into the specifics of this process a bit later, but the core difference we want to understand right now is the rather than Development and Introduction something based on assumptions, we instead focus the knowledge gained from the testing of those assumptions.  

So where the Development process before was taking the idea and preparing it for launch, the lean startup process is testing the idea itself.  This process has it’s own module, complete with tactics metrics, and accounting system.  But for now, we’re simply going to call the Idea stage.


That might be easy to say, but in practice it’s very difficult.  We have been trained to view learning as a process of execution.  Study the problem, figure out the answer, take the test.  This works when there is a body of knowledge available and when figuring out the answer is a process of discovery or deduction.  But when the answer is fundamentally unknowable in advance due to the high uncertainty or complexity, then the only way we can proceed is take the test and figure out the answer.  

Ultimately, this comes into direct conflict with the traditional approach because it can’t take no for an answer.  Mathematically it simply doesn’t work.  And this is why you have the NEA example.

So the heart of any innovation accounting solution must be accepting that the answer is “no.”.  In LSC parlance this is called a pivot.  In traditional, this is called failure.  They both happen when your concept fails to attract growth; It’s just that one is a planned, accounted for and is an informed decision, and the other is a negative waste of time and money that ultimately turns into a “blame and shame” .  


Outlined like this, it may seem obvious which way is the preferred approach.  However, keep in mind that the traditional funding mechanism forces us into the traditional approach.  You can’t produce a positive NPV that doesn’t guarantee future growth — it’s simply not mathematically possible.  You can compensate for the high risk associated with the project by increasing the discount rate, but that merely means you have to increase the growth estimates even further, which puts even greater pressure on the innovator to deliver the promised growth.  This is what I call the NPV death spiral, and it’s at the heart of every innovation disaster.
