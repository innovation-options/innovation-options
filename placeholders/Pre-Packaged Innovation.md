# Pre-Packaged Innovation


Placeholder for the simple-form of innovation inception:  forget about the forecasts and fix the amounts and gates.  This uses compound options as a theoretical backing, but is mostly intended to abstract the details of the option model entirely.  All ideas are equal until proven otherwise.  This gives the method for decision heuristics and checkpoints in advance.  It also removes the single-greatest difficulty in the approach: that options are valued based on variance more than forecasts.  Thus, by using early-stage valuations you can calculate the effective sigma that is employed in the valuation model.  

The overall goal is the same:  speed.  Remove the foolâ€™s game of predicting the future under conditions of uncertainty.  Make the focus on the evidence.  This takes the metered funding approach to its logical conclusion.

When facing uncertainty, speed wins.  So put the focus on speed.
