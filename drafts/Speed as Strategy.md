## Strategy

In general, humans find uncertainty very discomforting.  The natural response to this is to remove ambiguity at the source -- which in the business world means study, research and planning.  For mature products, this approach makes great sense as there is a wealth of history and experience from which to develop such plans.  However, for new products in new markets no such information is available, and so the foundations of any conclusions drawn are necessarily weak and speculative.

However, our desire for certainty remains strong.  So strong, in fact, that as Daniel Kahneman showed nearly fifty years ago we will prefer an answer we know to be wrong over no answer at all.  The result is billions upon billions of dollars lost in failed innovation projects and an innovation failure rate exceeding 95% as we choose false certainty rather than embrace the unknown.

Mature projects seek to root out and eliminate variation; however, variation is exactly what is needed in innovation projects.  We want to encourage it, to support breakthroughs which produce high-growth in new, unforeseen markets.

Our natural tendency is to remove uncertainty through careful planning and research.  If we just find the right expert, the person smart enough to divine the answer, then we’ll simply execute against his or her plan and win the game.

If this approach looks familiar its because it is the approach we take with mature products.  Our main business lines all operate on careful budging, planning and execution.  It looks very familiar to higher-level managers because that is the game they play every day (and have for most of their careers.)  It brings certainty by essentially saying “this person/approach will remove uncertainty by simply providing the answer”.

Unfortunately, in most cases this claim is illusory.  We only provide the facade of stability when the underlying conditions themselves have not been altered in the slightest.  We have a terrible track record of predicting the future.  McKinsey cell phones, WebVan, Google Glass.

Moreover, when we seek to remove uncertainty several psychological phenomena conspire to inflate our errors.  Due to ‘loss aversion’ we tend to make safe choices that result in sustaining v. disruptive innovations.

Also, by imbuing so much into the core plan, we encourage ‘motivated reasoning’, where we seek out and/or interpret data that reinforces our position while rejecting other information that counters it.

Uncertainty can only be addressed directly through trial and error.  Here we try to turn our assumptions into knowledge through repetition and experimentation.  Moreover, it reduces the overall riskiness of the project through the only mechanism available: iteration.  By breaking the project into smaller steps, we reduce the overall variance of the undertaking.

It’s worth noting here that we are discussing risk in the mathematical sense.  For many project managers, risk is mitigated through contingency planning.  “We know that there is a 5% chance of the supplier not providing a key part on time, so we’ll arrange for a different supplier as a contingency.”  This approach does not actually reduce the risk of the 5% event happening, but it does reduce the downside to the project overall.

Essential to contingency planning is knowing what can go wrong, the ramifications of that event, having a contingency available, and the relative frequency of the event to make the appropriate economic decision.  Of course, none of these are typically available under disruption.  Instead, we should look to reduce the intrinsic risk by simply reducing the investment in any one iteration to the smallest possible unit of time.  Thus, the strategic imperative is that of speed, not smarts.

It’s worth revisiting how the NPV approach reinforces the smarts approach.  Again, NPV demands that there be a significant future return to justify current investment.  Ultimately, the goal because to deliver on the original promises, which means those promises must be right.  In contrast, the speed strategy simply says “we need to be faster than our opponents.”  Focus on determining, rather than delivering.

This is actually quite difficult in practice.  Most key executives got to their positions by being very good at the firm’s main line of business.  Their ability to make solid predictions, run efficient businesses, and produce lots of profit enabled them to work up the corporate ladder.  Of course, they got the job in the first place because they aced their interview, giving all the right answers and making a good impression.  And they got those interviews because they performed very well in college, graduating with good grades from a prestigious university.  And they go into that university by doing well in secondary school, acing the SAT and all their classes.

In short, the definition of success for most executives reduces to one simple formula: know the answer before taking the test.  This is always true in school (at least, for most pedagogical styles) and is almost always true in mature markets.  There *is* a right answer, and we just need to find it.

All of this changes under conditions of uncertainty.  There might not be an answer at all, and it certainly isn’t knowable in advance.  Innovation projects fly in the face of this conventional wisdom and can be very disorienting to those who have lived their entire adult lives employing a different strategy.

Ultimately, the speed strategy is not about trying to guarantee success.  Yes, the chances of success do increase, but that is merely a side effect.  The core advantage to the speed approach is not in promising success (which is not possible) but by reducing the risk through iteration.  We remove the pressure to be right and replace it with the desire to learn the truth.

Our goal is to move away from the faith-based approach of following the mythic entrepreneur hero, and instead to the facts-based approach of high-speed iteration.  This is the central basis for creating a systemitizable innovation process that relialbly can produce repeatable returns.
