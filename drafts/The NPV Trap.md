## The NPV Trap

The most common way to show Return on Investment is called “Net Present Value”, or NPV.    NPV became the most popular way to calculate ROI because of its simplicity in concept and execution.  Forecast future revenues, calculate the investment required to generate those revenues, sum all those cash flows together discounted at the appropriate cost of capital and you’re done.  Simple, right?

The reason NPV typically works so well is that the managers who use it have a great deal of understanding on the product, the market, and the relative risk of a project.  This is his job after all, and it is not a stretch to extend forecasts when you have dozens of years of trends and historical data from which to draw.

For those accustomed to generating sales forecasts by dragging the bottom right-hand corner of excel this can be a bit daunting.   So the next best thing to using existing data is to use made-up data, preferably from a well-paid analyst report.  Thus, the revenue forecast becomes a market share estimate of what will be produced in the future when the product is a big hit.  

So we've got the cost forecast, and the revenue forecast, so the final piece of the puzzle is the discount rate, which accounts for the relative riskiness of the project.   This is an innovation project, so finance uses a high discount rate to account for the risk which devalues the project accordingly.  Of course, the PM knows that finance will do this, so they bump up their revenue projections even further to ensure their project gets over the funding threshold.  

In the end, what is submitted as a discipline in careful planning is actually an exercise in tweaking the excel spreadsheet until it generates a number big enough to be compelling but not so big to be farcical. 

What's most ridiculous about this scenario is that it is generally acknowledged (and accepted) that each side is making it up.  However, absent an alternative it is the only approach that approaches a semblance of corporate governance.

Again, the great thing about NPV is that it is a simple and consistent way to show the ROI of a given project.  And, when those forecasts are accurate, it does a really good job of that.  Unfortunately, NPV is a static analysis.  It requires that all information be available at the time of the original forecast, and doesn't adjust to the presence of new information.  

Any new information that runs contrary to the original forecast will change the NPV calculation, sometimes producing a negative return.  Meaning: any information that contradicts the original forecasts call into question the entire financial justification of the project.  This produces a clear incentive to delay, obfuscate, or outright reject reality in favor of the original plan.  Moreover, when it's time for quarterly reviews, if revenues do not match the original projections — as is almost always the case for projects dealing with uncertainty — the only solution to maintain the same NPV is to simply make larger revenue forecasts at points still further into the future.  

Again, the key is certainty.  The NPV Death Spiral begins the day that NPV is selected to show the ROI.  It sets up the project for failure, and continues to punish any and all activity that calls into question the original productions.  In short, it sets things up to do the exact opposite of what should be the goals for these projects: namely, making the unknown known.  

Yet while the NPV Death Spiral is the most obvious source of innovation failure, it actually isn't the worst thing that can happen.  In fact, far more deleterious to the firm is that most managers recognize the NPV Death Spiral and avoid it by simply not innovating at all.  

Remember, innovations don’t build themselves.  At some point a Product Manager needs to take the lead to make the idea real.  But if required to show the NPV, then that PM must make revenue projections that he intuitively knows are complete fabrications but nonetheless to which you will be held responsible role at quarterly review.  Should those fabrications prove correct, you will be acknowledged at having done your job correctly (you are an innovator, right?)   If you miss your targets you will be seen as unreliable at best, and at worst might lose your job (if the disaster is big enough and you're still around when that becomes obvious).  Very little upside, lots of downside.

Alternatively, if the idea is good enough, you can leave your job and start the company on your own.  Here you still might miss you targets and fail, in which case you're out of a job or career delayed at worst.  But the upside is dramatically different, since you'll have a huge equity stake in whatever you start.  Moreover, you can easily sell the company back to your original employer for millions instead of simply taking your salary and a pat on the back.

This is the Innovator's Dilemma.  It is a function of our accounting systems.  It and doesn't have to be this way.

The fundamental issue with this approach is that it demands high degrees of certainty from the outset and does not adjust when conditions change.  What we need instead is a new approach that instead of fighting uncertain understands that high-growth opportunities are uncertain by definition.  They should not be fought but embraced.
