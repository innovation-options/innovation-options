# Innovation Option Agreement
## Purpose
Innovation Project (the *Writer*) and Corporate (the *Holder*) wish to explore the viability of [Business Idea Name]() through an Innovation Option according to the following terms:

### Idea
[Describe the business idea here]().
`This should be a simple overview of the proposed business model.  Keep it short and descriptive; think “Elevator Pitch”.`

### Value Potential
[Indicate the Value-Potential Here]()
`This should be a large, round numnber that indicates the scope of the potential market opportunity.  Resist the urge for artificial precision; the ROI calculation is insensitive to this input so these efforts are misplaced.  Instead, just think about it in orders of magnitude.   Is it a $50M opportunity?  $100M?  $1B?  Of, if everything goes well, what could you sell it for in ten years?`

### Provisioning
[Propose your initial growth-capital requirement here.]()
`This is the amount the project will receive should finance exercise the option.  Unlike the Value Potential estimate, which is a far-future guess, the Provisioning amount should be backed by a detailed analysis of your expenses and working capital requirements during the first growth phase.  Think of this as a Series A investment.  Depending on the idea, the provisioned amount ranges from $2M - $20M, with a mean of around $8M.  `

### Budget Request
[Propose the option budget request here]()
`This is the amount you are requesting today.  It is the premium of the option itself.  Again, this should not be a guess, but instead represent the expenses you expect to incur as you explore the business opportunity.  The budget request also represents the amount of time you will have to conduct experiments, so you can also calculate it via burn rate X time required.  `

### Release Schedule
[Propose the release schedule here.]()
`The release schedule directly correlates to the option's risk measurement; the more frequently you iterate, the less the risk.    It also represents the touchpoints with finance where you will assess progress since the last iteration, so each period should be substantial enough to produce sufficient information such that a value determination can be made.  Moreover, once you commit to the schedule you must adhere to it, so balance these needs accordingly.`

### Expiration Date
[Specify the expiration date here]()
`This should line up to the budget request, release schedule and burn rate; regardless, indiciate a specific date here.`

## Calculations
[Return calculations here]()
`Use the option pricing calucator to determine the final calcuations of value, ROI, and sigma here. `

## Covenants
- The Writer will report to the Holder according to the release schedule, and the Writer and Holder will jointly assess the marginal progress for each interval.  In the case of disagreement on this assessment, the Holder’s assessment prevails.  
- The Writer is expected to iterate on the business idea for the duration of the option, yet will not receive any additional funds beyond this initial request.
- The Writer will be measured in iteration speed (i.e., was the Release Schedule met?) and accuracy of results (i.e., did the iteration assessments match reality?)  It is noted that while speed is a current measurement, accuracy is a lagging indicator that can not be assessed in real-time.
- The Holder understands that the budget request, once accepted, can not be modified ex post facto (i.e., the premium is non-refundable.)  
- The Holder understands that if the option is “in the money” at expiration, the expectation is that the provisioned amount will be allocated and the project will proceed to a growth phase. Again, as with the budget request, the provisioned amount is not subject to revision.  
- The Holder may exercise, sell to a third-party, or trade-in this option for another option at any time prior to the expiration date, with or without the consent of the Writer.

## Exercise Notification
