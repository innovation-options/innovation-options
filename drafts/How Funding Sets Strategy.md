# How Funding Sets Strategy


Now, I know you all plan to build the next great thing right out of the gate, but as I’ve been saying, there’s is a possibility, however unlikely, that your initial Innovation stage assumptions might be wrong. That’s perfectly fine, but if that's true, then you don't want to raise a lot of money right at the start of the process. Later in the course we’ll talk about what you need to do to convince your company to fund you, period, when you don’t even know what you’re doing yet. But for now, let’s assume you’ve gotten past that step and are just trying to figure out how much to ask for. 


Asking for too much, which is the traditional method of funding, is dangerous. It basically says, "Look, I'm going to promise the moon and beyond," so your investors give you money on the basis of that. And to them, innovation and growth are one and the same. They don’t know about the stages. They just think, “You promised me the moon. Where is my moon? You don't have my moon? You're done.” That's why traditional accounting regimens fail under conditions of uncertainty. They require, definitionally, a large, upfront investment. Because if you don't raise a lot of money, you can't generate a large net present value, as we discussed at the start of the course. But if you don't have a large enough NPV, somebody else that has a bigger NPV gets the money. 


At the end of the day, what you’re saying when you go into Finance is, “We've got this great idea." So, one person is saying, "I've got this great idea, I've got the best Gartner reports behind it, I've got all these experts, we're going to make $100 million in five years, absolutely guaranteed, where's my check?" And then you go up and say, "Yeah, I have no idea, but don't worry! I'm going to fail a lot as I find out. Can I have my money now?" Guess which one of these scenarios gets funding and which one gets kicked out of the office? 


The other problem with getting a huge amount of money upfront is that, again, because you’ve made a prediction based on an amount, it’s static and inflexible. Once you’ve made your assessment about the future you have to deliver on it. It doesn't matter if the circumstances have changed. It doesn't matter if what you've learned along the way tells you that that approach is not going to work and you need to do something else. You went to finance with an analysis that said, “This is the amount of money that I’m going to make.” They gave you the investment based on that analysis, so you can't change it. That’s why so many projects go wrong. This starting point encourages obfuscation because you don't want to tell finance, “Oh crap, I'm learning something different.” Even if it's good news, it completely undercuts the justification for your entire project. 


That’s why the solution is to raise or ask for the minimum amount of money that you need to learn faster than your competition about what you want to build. You have to make sure that you understand that when you accept a certain amount of money, you yourself have dictated the strategy for learning what you need to know to move forward. 


In the Innovation Stage, the key is not to take as much money as possible, but as little as necessary to justify the next level of investment. If you are able to demonstrate an effective growth engine, then the big check will always be there to fund that growth. But until that point, you want to remain below the “growth required” threshold. Eric Ries calls this “metered funding”, and it ensures that the learning you are gaining will be rewarded. To the corporate entrepreneur this can be difficult, since innovation finance is often oriented around stack ranked projects that get large dollar funding.
