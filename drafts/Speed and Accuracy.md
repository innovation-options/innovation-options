# Speed and Accuracy


One of the most difficult things to understand about Innovation Accounting is that the value it you’re measuring comes from the choice itself, rather than the results of that decision. It's not about the decision to move forward or not; it's about whether that choice turns out to be the accurate one.


To help illustrate this, let's use an example filled with uncertainty: oil exploration. Obviously petroleum companies do all they can to determine the best places to find oil. They conduct surveys, do geological analysis, and do all that is reasonable and practical to choose the best places to search. But at the end of the day, the goal is to know for certain you need to set up a rig and drill.


Now, let's simplify rig choices into two main classes: one is a production-ready rig. These are designed to extract large amounts of oil and put them into the pipeline. They’re immensely expensive to build, setup and maintain. The second class is a "wildcat" rig. These are small, less expensive, and are designed not to extract huge amounts but simply to test for the presence of oil. 


Both of these rigs drill holes and pump oil, but the purposes for them are very different. For the first rig, success or failure is dictated by whether or not you find oil. If there isn't any oil, then the project is considered a huge failure because of the cost and purpose of the rig. For the wildcat, the goal is simply to answer the question so that you can make an informed choice. If it doesn't hit oil that's still a success -- the cost of placing a huge rig that won't return is avoided, and the resources can be used elsewhere. Success and failure isn't dependent on the ultimate goal; it's determined by the accuracy of the determination. So, for instance, if the wildcat says "we drilled but there was no oil here", but they didn't drill deeply enough and missed the oil just a hundred feet away, that would be a failure. It isn't the presence or absence of oil that matters, only the accuracy of the decision itself counts. 


In addition to accuracy, there is a second metric that matters to the wildcatter: the speed of testing. Let's say that there are two wildcat rigs that both test for oil, but one can drill a hole once a week while the other takes longer to set up and can only drill once a month. Clearly you’d want to use the first rig because by drilling more holes you get more answers to the question of "where's the oil". To take this to its ridiculous conclusion, if you could drill a hole once a second then you'd know where all the oil is on the planet within a year.


Now, it's worth emphasizing that by moving faster you’re not improving your odds of finding oil in any given hole; each trial is independent from one another. What you are doing is making your overall success more likely because you’re giving yourself more opportunities to learn, even if it entails a lot of dry holes -- and greater expense. Remember the wildcat rigs don't come for free. 


Now, if you knew for absolute certainty that there was oil in a given location, clearly the best course of action would be to put a big rig right there. While bother with a wildcat? It's just a needless expense that will detract from profitability. Assume, decide, go. That’s traditional accounting.


But if there is high uncertainty, and you don't want to incur the risk of a dry big rig, then you would prefer the wildcat approach. Lots of little holes, getting accurate answers quickly. You wouldn’t punish the wildcat operator for not finding oil -- you would only sanction them for giving an inaccurate answer or for moving slower than the competition. 


These two metrics, speed and accuracy, form the basis for KPIs under an innovation accounting system.


Speed is measured merely as the number of tests run over a particular period of time. We don't need to take the results of those tests into consideration at all. To use our wildcatting example, we're simply measuring the number of holes drilled per week. You get to decide what constitutes a test, and you get to decide the time scale. As long as the test is real -- meaning that it actually generates validated learning -- and you keep the time scale consistent, then getting faster is in and of itself a useful metric.


A frequent concern I hear is from companies that feel they can't move fast because of their industry. It might be really slow like industrial engines, or heavily regulated like health care, or some other concern that suggests speed is not a useful KPI. However, this generally misses the point.


To explain, let me share a joke: two men are standing on a hill on the African savanna, when they spot a menacing lion eyeing them hungrily and heading their way. One of the men bends over and starts to put on his running shoes, prompting the other to say, "That's really stupid -- you can't outrun a lion." To which the first reples, "I don't have to outrun the lion: I just have to outrun you." The point of this is -- speed is relative. The point isn't to try to find some absolute benchmark, but simply to be faster than your opposition. If you can drill 10 holes to your competition's 2, then you’re going to be a much better position to find oil sooner. 




The second metric, accuracy, is measured by the veracity of the information you gather you make and wholly independent of the return of that decision. 


To use the wildcatting example, finding oil is considered "Positive", and not finding oil is considered "Negative". The only answers we want from our testing are either 1. the wildcat says there is oil, and that in fact is true. Or 2.  the wildcat says there is no oil, and that is in fact true. 


Measuring speed and accuracy are important for all stages of Innovation Accounting. In the next video, we’ll look at the key metric for measuring progress in the Idea Stage that will tell you when it’s time to transition to the Innovation Stage.
