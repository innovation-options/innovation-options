# The Rogers Technology Adoption Lifecycle


The Technology Adoption Lifecycle was developed by Everit Rodgers in 1954, and is considered one of the most important marketing insights of the last century.  In it, he described how a new innovation diffusions through an environment following a predicable pattern.

The curve itself is a normal distribution (ie, a bell-curve) that is familiar to all adoption cycles;  things start slow, speed up as the concept takes root, and then slows down as a function of market saturation.  Rodgers noticed that users adopted for different reasons at specific points on the overall curve, and envisioned five district groups based on their motivation.

Specifically, the five groups were:

- Innovators
- Early Adopters
- Early Majority
- Late Majority
- Laggards

Innovators  are first on the scene.  They are willing to try new productions simply because they are new.  

Early Adopters are next in line.  They are willing to try new products if they believe that product solves a problem they have.  

Early Majority also need to have a problem to solve, but they will only try new products if they see other people are using them.  

Late Majority no longer have a particular need, but adopt instead because everyone else is using the product and they don’t want to be left out.

Laggards neither have a need nor care about others; they adopt because they are forced because nothing else is available.

Thus described, we can view the segments in the following 2x2 matrix:  the horizontal axis describes whether or not your product solves a problem that the segment has at the time, where the vertical axis describes whether others are already using the product.  The arrow shows the overall market adoption path.

The Innovators come for free.  They’re always on the lookout for the “Next Big Thing” and are eager to find you.  Innovators are are a great way to shake out initial bugs and defects, and identify other blind spots in your value chain. However, their enthusiasm is not indicative of any greater trend.  They the smallest cohort (2.5% of the total) and once the ‘newness’ of your product dies off they are no longer interested, instead focusing on the next “Next Big Thing”.    Innovators don’t care about whether or not you’re solving a problem because that’s not the point: for them, it’s the newness that matters.  

The Early Adopters do have a problem, and are willing to take a risk on products they believe will solve that problem.  They may see others using the products, but their primary decision criteria will be an assessment of the product characteristics themselves.  If the Early Adopters believe that your product will solve their problem they will take a chance on it.  They don’t care about existing usage; in fact, they are often looking for an advantage over their competitors and so trying something of which others’ aren’t aware is a plus.

The Early Majority also have problem to solve, but unlike the early adopters they are more risk-averse and aren’t willing to take a chance on it until they see others using it. They consider product characteristics, but also need to see testimonials and other social proof in order to adopt.  This segment is more than twice as large as the first two combined, and represents when a product goes “mass market”.  

When we reach Late Majority the product is already well-diffused in the population. The original problem is now considered solved; instead, the main worry for adopters is being left out.  For the Late Majority, the only thing that matters is that everyone else is using it.  The Late Majority is equal in size to the Early Majority and remains squarely within the realm of mass marketing.  

The Laggards are the final segment who are basically forced to adopt because there is no alternative.  They don’t care about solving a problem, but since literally everyone else is already using the product, substitutes are no longer easily available.  Strictly speaking, Laggards care about neither problems nor usage, but since they are forced to adopt as a consequence of usage it is still more practical to share the quadrant with the Late Majority rather than the Innovators.

# Implications

The nature of the technology adoption cycle has strong implications for your marketing strategy and tactics.  For instance, with the top and bottom halves of the matrix represent 15% and 85% of the market, respectively, it should be obvious that mass market appeals should be reserved until the early majority is evident.  And, since the right-half adopts based on the problem-solving aspects of your product, marketing there should focus on the product characteristics first and foremost.  

Since we’re focused on innovation, we’re going to concern ourselves first and foremost with the top half of the matrix.  Ample advice exists on the concept of mass marketing; we’re going to focus on the first two quadrants and, most critically, the transition between the early adopters and early majority.

As mentioned, Innovators come for free.  Their interest is in the novelty of your product, the newness of it.  They want to see what it is, how it works, what unique characteristics it has and how it might shape the future.  Innovators don’t have a particular need and are very quick to adopt.  

This makes sense in terms of the matrix, since there are no usage or solution requirements at this stage of the product lifecycle.  Outbound marketing is of course required at this stage; since there are no users the only way people can find out about the product is if the company tells them about it.  However, the primary focus during this time should be honing the marketing message to appeal to the early adopters in the next quadrant.  

The transition between the innovators and adopters is sometimes referred to as “Problem/Solution Fit”.  Problem/Solution fit is achieved when the product you are offering matches the perceived need of a segment of customers.  Now the “problem” here doesn’t necessary imply some overt pressing need; often the customer doesn’t know they have a problem at all, let alone be in a position to articulate it.  This mostly means that when conveying the product characteristics you can do so in a way that attracts the attention of customers.  

Now while this may seem self-evident, it is very often true that products are created that never actually fulfill a customer need, latent or otherwise.  This is often referred to as “a solution in search of a problem”.  Entrepreneurs often themselves are “Innovators” in the technology adoption concept, and so producing something new is attractive for its own sake.  Still, in order to transition to the next stage the product must in some way solve a problem that resonates with a least a small portion of the overall market.

The key thing to know about Problem/Solution fit is that it represents an expression of intent; whether or not the product fulfills the need is actually a secondary concern.  As such, product availability may be scarce or indeed the product need not exist beyond prototype if at all.  The main concern is that you’re able to identify a particular unmet need and articulate the solution in a digestible manner.  

Perhaps the crispest way to demonstrate Problem/Solution fit is Kickstarter or other product-launch platforms.  Using these tools an entrepreneur sells the product proposal, sometimes with prototypes or other pre-market product demonstrations.  Those which articulate a problem worth solving are able to secure commitments from backers to bring the product to market.  

At risk of stating the obvious, the transition between Innovators and Early Adopters is always the first step in the pipeline: if you can’t get anyone’s interest then nothing else is possible.  Thus, initial metrics should be tailored to gauge the degree of problem/solution fit.  

It’s worth noting that at this early stage what is really being tested is the basic concept: no actual product is needed at this point.  Consider the Kickstarter example: yes, having working prototypes or other demonstrations is better than not, but no one yet has an actual product in their hands.  This is more about demonstrating that demand exists, rather than on the supply. 

<Also, remember that when seeking Problem/Solution fit it’s important to focus on activities that produce Validated Learning.  Validated Learning is a Lean Startup concept that is beyond the scope of this article, but in short it means that we should rely on the activities of real customers in the real world, rather than research reports, user surveys, focus groups, or other opinion-focused scenarios.  Even tests as simple as clicking on a  Google Adwords link or a pre-order are more indicative of problem/solution fit than any hypothetical scenario.>

The purpose of the first transition point is to answer the question: should we build a product at all?  Does my solution address an actual problem that people have?  Again, this may seem self-evident, but there are plenty of examples of products built and launched with great fanfare at the cost of millions — and in some cases billons of dollars — that never achieved any interest beyond mere Innovators.

There are no hard and fast rules when judging Problem/Solution fit.  In general whatever interest you see should be sufficient to justify the investment required for the next (or initial) product iteration.  However, as a practical matter the first step is binary:  meaning, is there any interest at all?  The entrepreneur can see the future in ways that others can’t; this is what makes visionary leaps possible.  However, if the early adopters don’t share this vision then we should not move forward.  We should not be looking to “educate the market” or  otherwise trying to bend the customer to our will.  Instead, we should be seeking to demonstrate that the customers have a particular need and a willingness to act upon that desire.  

Problem/Solution fit is about expectations.  If you have provided a solution to a demonstrated customer need, you’ve created an expectation in the customer’s mind  — now the purpose is to fulfill that expectation.  This may be as simple and obvious as producing the product you promised, or it may be refining an existing product that showed some promise but didn’t wholly fulfill expectations.  all this is too long and repetitive

Once we have moved into stage two, our new goal is to transition to the Early Majority.  This is the most critical transition as it represents the true market opportunity.  Making the transition means that you are starting to fulfill a mass-market need and are starting up the fabled “Hockey Stick” of growth.  This transition is more difficult and the stakes are much higher since we are now producing actual products and are making more significant investments.  The gap between the early adopters and early majority is often called “the Chasm”, a term popularized by Geoffrey Moore in his seminal work “Crossing the Chasm”.  

Going back to our matrix, we can see that by demonstrating a solution we were able to attract the attention of our early adopters.  The early majority also need to recognize the same problem — but they also need to see the solution in action, demonstrated by the product itself.  It’s insufficient to merely be told about the product characteristics; they must actually see the usage and/or its results.

It’s this last part that creates Moore’s “chasm”.  Early stage entrepreneurs may be able to attract early adopters because of the promise of a solution, but if those customers do not produce conspicuous enough usage to attract the attention of the early majority then the bottom falls out of the market and the initiative plummets into the chasm.  

To transition, the Early Majority must see conspicuous usage from the Early Adopters.   This means that the primary objective of your product is to actually deliver on the value proposition and solve the problem for your customers.  Remember, Early Adopters will buy your product on the promise of a solution; but they will only use the product if it is an actual solution.  If they churn out because you oversold expectations or otherwise don’t fulfill the value proposition, then there is no one for the Early Majority to see using the product, and the chasm gets wider.  

To transition to the early-majority, and the mass market opportunity it provides, you must have a product that provides conspicuous enough usage to attract other members of the early-majority.  We can’t simply measure aggregate adoption because again if we don’t distinguish between early adopters and early majority we risk racing directly in the chasm if we scale too quickly.  In order to have confidence that we should seek growth investment, we must be able to track the source of growth.  Since overall growth numbers will still be low and lacking in history or context, the One such metric is the WOM/PROM index score, or WPS.  WPS provides a consistent measure of how much your product usage itself generates new usage (which is the only source of non-linear growth.)

The early majority transition is so critical because it represents the event-horizon of funding; supporting early majority growth requires resources that typically requires significant outside funding.  Up to this point the funding has been Seed , Angel or perhaps even bootstrapped.  These investments tend to be more forgiving in the sense that they are speculative by nature and don’t insist upon immediate growth or profit.  Their goal is to provide a future investment opportunity when the firm transitions into larger markets and funding rounds.  This provides greater room for the degree of experimentation and trial and error that is typical of startups.

The early majority transition, in contrast, generally is supporting some current growth with the promise of even more explosive growth — that is the point of raising the money, to expand the existing growth engine and get it revving even faster still.  Again, this is why the chasm is so deadly to startups: if they misinterpret early adopter support and raise money before the early majority adopts, their growth stalls and future funding becomes impossible.  

The final transition is from early to late-majority users.  Here, the growth engine is well-operating and has been for some time.  However, the overall growth curve, while still growing, is growing at a slower rate (for the calculus geeks, the second derivative has turned negative.).  At this point more than half the market has transitioned to the new product, and so the question of “solving a problem” is no longer relevant because the risk-profile flips:  meaning, the risk isn’t from using the product when no one else is, it’s the risk of *not* using the product when everyone else is. 


For the main usage of Innovation Accounting, the critical point is to ensure that 

There is still more than half the market remaining, but it is at the point that a profit engine to match the growth model must be clearly established.  It is worth pointing out that many businesses could establish a profit engine well before it is required and yet choose not to do so.  Amazon is a famous example of a firm that priorities growth above profit whenever possible, and strategically that is wise — in expanding markets prioritizing profit may stunt the overall potential and value of the market, to say nothing of the strategic positioning that growth provides.  Still, at some point every business must become profitable, and this final transition  — certainly no later than when the overall growth starts to slow — represents the prioritization of profit over growth.  

Like the transition between early-adopter to early-majority, this transition is permanent:  firms that no longer have the opportunity for hyper-growth can not secure speculative funding.  Any financing must come from free cash flow or sources which demand an immediate return.  This is no longer about betting on the future; it’s about harvesting the present.  Yes, we continue to grow while in the early majority, but this growth is no longer the leaps and bounds of new market potential, but the growth of the overall population, or due to stealing market share from competitors.  In either case, profit is the final stage and we can no longer tolerate losing money.  Lack of performance leads to cost-cutting, layoffs or, in the final analysis, end-of-life for the products or the firm.
