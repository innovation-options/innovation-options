It is important to note that since each iteration represents an assessment of where the idea stands against reality, each iteration must map to a real-world test of one of the idea’s core assumptions. This is called “validated learning”, and it means that our assessment must result from actual customer interaction rather than research or hypotheticals. Thus, the number of iterations should tie directly to the anticipated release cycle for prototypes and other minimal viable product releases. Release cycles themselves are generally related to the sector: again, in our consumer internet v. biotech example, the release cycle of the former is generally measured in weeks, while the latter might be months. The ultimate value of the option is not terribly sensitive to the number of iterations, but holding outcomes to iterations performed does have benefits for effective corporate governance.

consider the term for the Innovation Option. Theoretically the term can be any duration, but as a practical matter the option represents the period during which we are gathering new market information so that we can make an informed decision about whether or not to exercise the option (ie, whether or not the Strike investment will be profitable).  These research activities cost money, and so the duration of the option is bounded by the amount of money in question divided by the burn rate.  Therefore, the amount budgeted for exploration is the option Premium (ie, the amount of money that will be spent whether or not the option is exercised) and the option expiration is the date on which that money is depleted.







#### Calculating the Return on Investment

At this point we have all the inputs and equations needed to construct an innovation option and determine the ROI of that investment. To review, we need:

*   The amount of funding sought to bring the product to market ($S$, $K$)
*   The term of the option in years ($T$)
*   The iterations expected during that term ($i$)
*   The sigma ($\sigma$)
*   The risk-free rate ($r$)
*   The premium ($P$)

Using these values, you then build the expected values in Step One.
Next, you calculate the exercise payoff in Step Two.
Finally, you determine the discounted expected values in Step Three.

You now have the option’s initial value at Node Zero. This represents the value in today’s dollars to determine the actual growth potential of the proposed investment. Thus, to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) of the option we simply subtract the cost required to produce the market information we need to run our iterations. This cost is called the Premium, and it reflects the cost of the option itself (as opposed to the Strike, which represents the proposed future investment.) The difference between the option’s value and its premium is what I call the Option’s Present Value (OPV) and that is its ROI.

For example, let’s suppose we have an idea for a new consumer internet service, say a social network for pets. The idea would need an investment of $3M to bring the concept to market. We’d like to spend 90 days to gather market data to determine the answer, and expect to iterate once a week during that time. The upper bound Series A valuation is determined to be $100M, and the risk-free rate is 1% (current T-bill rate). The budget for the 90 days would be $90K, or $30K a month, fully-burdened.

Using the Innovation Options model, we determine that the initial value of this option is $800K. However, since we’re only spending $90K, the option represents an ROI of $710K to the firm. It’s also worth noting that the option’s initial value represents the highest possible budget to explore the idea--anything more than that destroys value and has a negative OPV.

#### Measuring Progress

In addition to providing an initial ROI for the option, we can also use the model to measure progress. Recall that the lattice represents the range of possible future values, with each node being a combination outcomes to that point in time. Thus, within that range one of the combinations reflects reality. Or, returning to our storm tracker analogy, when the storm has passed it will have taken a path through the cone that was originally predicted. The path is within the cone; we just don’t know which path yet.

Thus, to estimate the value of the option at any given point in time we simply need to determine which path is real. Since each move represents the up/down/flat determination at each node, to deduce the current estimated value we only need to make periodic assessments relative to the prior iteration. Thus, determining progress reduces to a single, tractable question: “are we in a better, worse, or about the same position as we were before?” Remember, we’re not re-calculating anything; we’re just making assessments along the way which, in aggregate, tell us where we are.

This value estimation is directly related to the number of iterations `i` during the life of the option. The greater the number of possible nodes, the greater the fidelity in the possible future value. Thus, we’re encouraged to conduct as many iterations as possible to improve our value estimation. That said, there are practical limitations to how frequently you can iterate since each must represent a qualified assessment of actual market conditions for the result to be valid. Generally speaking, iteration speed is a function of the market sector: consumer internet ideas might be testable on a weekly basis, while hardware could take a month per release. Yet regardless of speed, it is absolutely critical that each assessment represent the result of actual market data and not conjecture or opinion. The whole point of the option is to inform the investment decision with market data; relying on speculation defeats the entire purpose of the exercise.
