For instance, Dave McClure of [500 Startups](http://500.co) recently went on a tirade noting that investors should not be asking for revenue projections from startups because they are nothing but lies.

Founders remotely honest with themselves know that revenue projections for pre-growth startups are total fabrications, but if they are demanded by investors then a founder is going to produce them. Some unscrupulous investors may later use the (invariably missed) projections as a pretext to beat down the entrepreneur on subsequent valuations, but even absent such malfeasance once revenue projections become part of “the plan” then founders feel the pressure to deliver on that promise even if it was unrealistic at inception.

In the investors’ defense, VCs are in the business of generating returns like any other fund manager and can’t be expected to just throw money around without some indication of the payback. Still, investors need a model that can produce an ROI calculation without employing fantasy revenue projections that distort the entire process.
