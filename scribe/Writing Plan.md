# Writing Plan

## Time and Place: Home, before kids get up (min 1 hour)
No distractions, no email, no phone, don’t even check the news.  Just get up, get coffee, and get going.  
## Benchmark:  250 words per day.  
 This gets a first draft done in four months.
## Deadline: A chapter per two weeks.
This is a moderate pace and may change as the chapters themselves develop
## Editing: two months
Again, may change based on level of content but is reasonable starting point


**Don’t edit until the first draft is done!**
