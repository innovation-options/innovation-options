# Outline

## Introduction
1. Hook
You're in danger of disruption.  The world is moving faster (S&P Chart).  You need to innovate faster, but can't.  And you can't because of all the things that make you successful as a large company make you fail at innovation.  97% failure rate.  This is a not a failure of your systems, but a direct consequence of it.  To break this cycle, you need to take a different approach that allows you to innovate at a speed an order of magnitude faster than you are today.

2. Who it’s for
This book is for corporate executives who stay up at night worrying about future growth opportunities for their companies.  It will appeal to the CEO, CFO, CIO, etc primarily, but anyone who is responsible for innovation in a large corporation will benefit from its insights.  If you're unsatisifed with the speed at which your firm is innovating, or have ever-present FOMO on the next opportunity, or can't seem to figure out why you keep investing heavily in ideas only to have them become expensive public failures, or have a history of over-paying for acquisitions only to have them fail to integrate into your infrastructure, or recognize that you continue to do the same thing over and over expecting different results and have said there *must* be a better way: This book is for you.

3. Stories of Problem
On a recent client site-visit I noticed a wall on which were written 100 potential business ideas. Rising fifteen feet off the ground, the list represented wide-ranging opportunity and enormous potential value. Curious, I asked about the progress on each of them, learning that only two were being pursued -- the rest languishing as mere words on a wall.

So those two were chosen because they were judged the most likely to succeed.  Or so they thought.  And since you're reading this book, you've likely already guessed that they were both spectacular failures -- financially and to the public reputation of the firm.  And to add insult to injury, one of the ideas on the wall that was completely ignored by the firm since they concluded it wasn't viable was pursed by a startup and became a runaway success and purchased by a large competitor just a few years later.

My client was following a common pattern: the innovation team formulated ideas based on the hottest trends, estimating the return on investment for each using thorough research and market analysis.   Those ideas were then funded in ranked ROI order until the entire innovation budget was allocated -- which in this case was a grand total of two. So, as a matter of policy, the firm was deliberately ignoring 98% of their innovation and putting the firm at tremendous risk of disruption.

The core problem is that this corporate governance method forces us to make the most critical decision at the precise moment we have the leasat amount of information.  Instead we need a financing approach that is able to delay major investment decisions until we have more information about the market while simeultaneously providing an accounting approach that provides positive ROI and mangement metrics.

This will take a different kind of courage.  The C-Suite level executives for whom I'm writing this book are incredibly successful at managing large-scale enterpresies, and got there by following a competitive but nonetheless well-worn path of producing profit at scale.  But the  approach  that got you here will not work for breakthrough innovation.  YOu're going to need to think differently, act differently, and most important give up the control that works for mature products but is wholly illusory for early-stage opportunities.

And I also must warn you in advance that it's not likely to work for your company.  Please don't misunderstand: the approach itself does work and has worked for thousands of innovators who have produced hundreds of billions of dollars in value.  I'm merely saying that in my nearly twenty years of experience consulting for dozens of companies I've only had a handful of firms willing to commit to what's necessary to make it succeed.

I always managed to get initiatives launched, teams formed, and people really, really excited about the approach and possibilities.  SOme of these projects lasted longer than others, but eventually corporate culture always ate strategy for breakfast.  It was disheartening, yet utlimately unsurprising.

This pattern repeated itself so frequently that I could no longer run my consulting practice in good faith, concluding that despite the desire, resources, and some damn good people large firms are simply incapable of taking the speed-based approach to innovation.  Instead, I formed my own firm that provides innovation options to firms who have more ideas than investments, doing all the work for them so that they are provided with actual evidence on whether or not their project will succceed or fail.

That said, my fervent desire is that you never use my services.  While better than nothing -- and way better than a high-profile and expensive innovation disaster -- these skills are best employed within your company itself.  Doing so will mitigate the problems associated with integrating products, intimately understand how you got to product/market fit, and allow your firm to accumulate the experience necessary to win at the repeated game.  Everything in this book will give you those skills and more, so that you can develop the people, systems and tools to make consistent innovation part of your company DNA.

You can do it.  You should do it.  I only provide you this warning because in all liklihood you won't do it.

Now prove me wrong.


## Chapter: The NPV Trap

What’s the ROI?
