# Transcript

Imagine yourself as a product manager for a large Fortune 500 firm with a new product idea. So you go to finance and say, "Hey, I've got this idea and need some funding." And they say, "Great, the firm needs new innovation -- what's the ROI?". 


So no problem, calculating Return on Investment is easy:  you just have to put together a spreadsheet that figures out the future return less the current investment.  Now finance will probably discount your estimates a bit, so you might want to pad up the numbers, but as long as the result is above zero you'll get your funding.  Simple, right?


So you start by figuring out how much funding you'll need to build, launch, and market your new product.  You do budgeting all the time for your existing product lines, so knocking out the Investment part is easy.  Halfway there!


Then you move on to the Return, and now you start to get a little nervous. Now revenue forecasting with an existing product is easy: you can count the customers, you can tally the sales, you can drag your spreadsheet to the right because you have the numbers on the left.  But this idea is *new*, and you have *none* of that.  You're facing a lot of uncertainty.
Still, you can't produce an ROI without the R, so you try your best to figure out the answer.  You look at the latest market forecasts, you read a few Gartner reports -- heck, you might even throw in the latest Forbes article about the "next big thing".  And after all that research, you hold your breath and make up the numbers as best you can -- oh, and don't forget that padding.  After all, you're not the only one pitching new ideas, so this better be a really compelling ROI.  Then you go to finance and hope for the best -- with more than a little apprehension not only for the pitch, but the quarterly progress reviews that will follow. 
Now I've worked with hundreds of corporate innovators, and they are just as smart, committed and capable as any lone entrepreneur working out of his garage.  But we really are putting them in an impossible position: finance is forcing them to make predictions despite massive uncertainty, and will hold them accountable should they fall short. If they hit their numbers, they get a pat on the back, but if they miss, then they are considered unreliable and best, and, if the disaster is big enough, they might lose their job because they had this great idea.  And when you think of it this way, it's amazing corporate innovation happens at all.


Now before we point the finger at finance, we have to recognize that they are just as important as the product manager.  Finance allocates the scarce resources of the firm among competing interests, and that's not an easy job.  And if we're not supposed to use ROI then what's the alternative?  Just write checks to everyone -- no accountability, no metrics -- just spray and pray?  That makes even less sense.


The fundamental issue is that as Yogi Berra famously quipped, “it’s tough to make predictions — especially about the future.”  But the mechanics of traditional accounting require us to exactly that.  It demands certainty from the outset, and doesn't adjust when conditions change.  In today's markets, where uncertainty and change are the norm, that approach is ludicrous on its face -- and borne out by a corporate innovation failure rate typically pegged at over 90%.


But this failure isn't due to the product managers, or finance, and not even those Gartner reports.  It's an accounting system that forces us the most critical decision at the precise moment we have the least information.  We don't need traditional accounting, we need innovation accounting.  Not inventive accounting -- that gets you into prison -- Innovation accounting.


So what is innovation accounting? I like this definition from Eric Ries, who popularized The Lean Startup, and from whom you'll hear later on in the course. Innovation accounting is a way of evaluating progress when all the metrics we'd typically use are effectively zero.  It's a corporate governance framework designed specifically to handle the high uncertainty environments characteristic of breakthrough innovation, while maintaining the core features of consistency, materiality and comparability required of an accounting system.


That is what innovation accounting does, and that is what this course is all about.


In the next video, I'll explain more in detail what the course covers, and what you can expect from it. 
Intro #2 - Module 0: Lesson 2 (alternative take)


Why should we worry about accounting at all? What's the purpose? Well, precisely defined, accounting is a system that identifies, records and communicates information that is relevant, reliable and comparable, to help managers make better decisions.


And that's why accounting forms the basis of modern management.  Because you can't manage what you don't measure.  And in the case of innovation -- because measuring the wrong things leads directly to wrong management. 


Now most of us are familiar with financial accounting, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, the basics that guide overall business cycle.  But there is also cost accounting for day-to-day management, forensic accounting to discover fraud, tax accounting to manage taxes -- different accounting systems that take different forms, because they accomplish different purposes. And so to that canon, we want to add innovation accounting, which is specifically designed to deal with the process of product development when facing high uncertainty.


So is this course for you? Well, let me tell you a story to help answer that question. A few years ago, I conducted some workshops on entrepreneurship at an enterprise corporation that has been remakably successful for the last hundred years, but was facing disruption in some of their core industries.  They wanted to learn how to apply startup principles within their organiation and so they called me in.


So I stood in front of this room of about 80 product managers from all areas of the company, and I dutifully plowed through my slides. I extolled the virtue of taking risks.  I lectured that they'll need to get comfortable with failure.  I encouraged them to move fast and break things.  Now some attendees were mildly intrigued, but the telltale signs of skepticism were evident: crossed arms, confused looks, and furrowed brows on every forehead.


When I paused for questions, a product manager in his mid fifties with salt and pepper hair, raised his hand and said, "Is this really for everyone? I mean, how much do I really need to experiment? I've been in this business 30 years, and I know that if I improve my product by 10% and reduce my costs by 15%, I'm going to get 7% net increase in sales. I really don't need to move fast, and I sure as hell am not going to break things." Mercifully, the attendees didn't burst out into applause, but the nodding approval was so furious I thought they had all suddenly transformed into bobblehead dolls.


And the plain and simple truth was, he was right.  If you're in an established product line that makes incremental progress you don't need any of this stuff.  Saying you need to get comfortable with failure is like saying you need to get comfortable with suicide.  And as long as the world is stable and predicable, Steady as she goes. 
But any change, in technology, regulation, legal rulings, social unrest, business trends -- through all that into turmoil.  Steady as she goes only works if things are steady.  Any when you consider that the average age of companies in the S&P 500 has dropped from 60 years in 1950 to less than 20 years today, just how steady are things? 
And that's who this class is for.  It's for companies that are seeking the tools they need to better manage an uncertain world. 




So here's what you can expect from this course.


First, we're going to go through the four main stages of innovation, based on the product lifecycle, and describe what makes each stage unique.  We'll breakdown the driving factors of each stage, and set up an Innovation Dashboard that will track the two main Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, that measure progress in each stage.


Next, we're going to go through the corresponding four transitions that take place between the stages.  We'll examine the technology adoption lifecycle that drives customer behavior, map those to goals and objectives for each stage, and provide specific decision criteria based on our KPIs.  Moreover, we'll introduce the corporate governance concepts of Innovation Boards and Metered Funding.


Finally, we'll go through the entire Innovation Cycle, beginning to end, discussing the specifics for each of the four stages, and each of the four transitions between them, with plenty of real-world examples for context along the way.  When we're done, you'll have a solid grasp of the entire innovation process and innovation accounting system that will allow you to make smarter management decisions along the way.


And as a special bonus, we'll have an extended conversation with Eric Ries about the most effective way to introduce innovation accounting to your company.


And with that, let's get started!






Module 0: Lesson 1


Think back to my introduction to the story of the Product Manager with the new idea and put yourself in his shoes.  To figure out the return on investment, you'll produce a financial analysis that represents basically the net present value of the idea. Now, net present value may sound complicated, but really it's just the typical measure of spending versus return in corporate accounting. You predict what your idea will be worth in the future, and based on that prediction, you figure out how much money you need to spend today, taking a certain amount of risk into account, to get that return in the future.


As long as the difference between those two is positive, giving you a positive return on investment, a positive net present value, you're going to proceed with the project. Now for incremental innovation, the type where we're talking an existing product with an established customer base and sales history, this approach makes total sense. But in our scenario, your idea is new, and so you face extreme uncertainty. Everything is based on your prediction, but I can't tell you with certainty what the weather is going to be like in a week. How is anyone supposed to come up with 10-year revenue projections and profit margins for products that don't exist, in markets that don't exist?


Still, if you don't produce an ROI, you won't get funded. So you bite your tongue and make revenue projections that you intuitively know are complete fabrications. And after you're done filling out all those numbers in your spreadsheet, there's only one column that has any certainty; it's the column labeled "funding required", because while you can't guarantee future revenue, you can guarantee that whatever you raise, you will spend.


There are a few potential outcomes from doing things this way. Should your fabrications prove correct, you'll be acknowledged just having done your job well and brought something valuable to the company. Now, if you miss your targets, on the other hand, you'll be seen as unreliable at best and at worst, if the disaster is big enough and you're still around when it becomes obvious, you might lose your job.


The third scenario is that if the idea is good enough, you can leave your job and start the company on your own. You still might miss your targets and fail, in which case you're still out of a job. But if you succeed, the upside is dramatically different, since you'll have a huge equity stake in whatever you start, and in delicious karma, you can easily sell the company back to your original employer for millions, instead of simply taking your salary and a pat on the back.
Now, all three of these outcomes are functions of our flawed accounting system. Think of it this way. In the first outcome, you get lucky, and in the second, you inflict damage on your career, and in the third you take your innovation away from the company at the start, and if it's successful, they end up having to buy it back from you instead of having it kept in house. Now, this might be good for your bottom line, but it's not a very efficient way of doing business. But it's so common an occurrence, that a famous book was written about it called The Innovator's Dilemma.


The fundamental issue with the traditional accounting approach that creates all of these scenarios is that it demands high degrees of certainty from the outset, and doesn't adjust when conditions change. In today's markets, where change and disruption and uncertainty are the defining feature of business, that's the most ludicrous thing in the world, and yet this is the primary way that we fund our innovation.


We do our best to bolster our original projections with research reports and analyst assessments and forecasts about total future market size, but that isn't going to change the fundamental problem, which is that we're basing our entire return on investment approach on the assumption that we can make accurate far future forecasts when faced with extreme uncertainty. And when you put it that way, we shouldn't be at all surprised that the success rate for corporate innovation is typically pegged at less than 5%.


Now, I don't believe that's because the people that run these companies are in any way less capable than the lone entrepreneur in the garage. It's the accounting system that needs to change. We don't need traditional accounting, we need innovation accounting for the innovative work that we're doing. Not inventive accounting; that gets you into prison. Innovation accounting.


So what is innovation accounting? I like this definition from Eric Ries, who popularized The Lean Startup, and whom you'll hear from later on in the course. His definition is that innovation accounting is a way of evaluating progress when all of the typical metrics that we would use are at or effectively zero. No revenue, no users, no growth, just a prayer. So how do you measure progress? The problem in this situation of course, is how we calculate ROI. What's needed is an approach that can gauge the progress of innovation, what finance and your corporate team needs for effective corporate governance, without requiring you to make accurate predictions you simply can't make. Instead, we need an approach that values turning our assumptions into knowledge, the learning that needs to happen, so that we can increase certainty to produce a stable and sustainable business. That is what innovation accounting does, and that is what this course is all about.


In the next video, I'll explain more in detail what the course covers, and what you can expect from it. 




Module 0: Lesson 2


Why should we worry about accounting at all? What's the purpose? Well, ultimately the purpose of accounting is to have a set of measurements so that you know where you are, where you're going, and how you're performing along the way. The accounting system provides a consistent set of guidelines and rules, that allow you to use that measurement in a way to share progress with others, in a form that they'll understand. And accounting systems form the basis of modern management, because you can't manage what you don't measure. So precisely and succinctly defined, accounting is a system that identifies, records and communicates information that is relevant, reliable and comparable, to help managers make better decisions.


Now, as I mentioned in the introduction, when we're facing extreme uncertainty, the traditional approaches that we use either don't measure at all or measure the wrong things, which lead directly to bad management.


The point of innovation accounting is to provide a consistent set of rules and approach that map to the goals we're trying to accomplish with the innovation in the face of extreme uncertainty. Once established and agreed to, these new KPIs and metrics form the basis of our other decisions such as hiring, promotion, product advancement, and so on.


The critical thing to understand here is that there's no such thing as a one size fits all accounting approach. Now this is true of accounting itself. Most of us are familiar with financial accounting, the balance sheets, profit and loss statements that we see, but there's also forensic accounting, management accounting, cost accounting, a variety of different accounting systems that take different forms, because they accomplish different purposes. And so to that canon, we want to add innovation accounting, which is specifically designed to deal with the process of new product creation when faced with high uncertainty.


What can you expect from this course? Well, let me tell you a story to help give you some context. A few years ago, I conducted some workshops on lean startup principles of rapid iteration and experimentation, when facing high uncertainty. Now, I did this at an venerable enterprise corporation that had been successful for the better part of a century, but was still facing pressures from the outside world and disruption in some of their core industries.


I sat in front of this room of about 80 product managers from all areas of the company, and I dutifully plowed through my slides. I spoke of my entrepreneurial experience, and extolled the virtue of taking risks and moving fast and breaking things. I lectured them on the importance of failing fast. And some attendees were mildly intrigued, but the telltale signs of skepticism were everywhere: crossed arms, furrowed brows, and the periodically raised eyebrow of suspicion.
When I paused for questions, the product manager, in his mid fifties with salt and pepper hair, raised his hand and said, "Now, is this really for everyone? I mean, how much do I really need to experiment? There's just not that much to gain. I've been in this business 30 years, and I know that if I improve my product by 10% and reduce my costs by 15%, I'm going to get 7% net increase in sales. It's just that simple. I really don't need to do any of this. I know the answer, and I just have to go do that. That's what we do here." Thankfully, the attendees didn't burst out into applause out of courtesy to me, but judging from the smiles that I saw in the audience, Lord knows they wanted to.


Now clearly, this product manager knew why incremental innovation was good for his business, but he was in an established product line that had always run on incremental continuous innovation, and as long as the world is stable and that fundamental core business doesn't change, that's great. But any significant break, from the world, from technology, from regulation, from legal ruling, social unrest, social trends, means that his fundamental business is destroyed with no capability of responding. And having the capability to respond is what this course is for. By using the innovation accounting methods I'm going to walk you through, you'll learn how to turn your assumptions about your idea into knowledge, and how to measure progress along the way, and present that progress in such a way that you won't get killed for failing to return an immediate profit.


Module one is going to take you through the product life cycle and how it relates to four distinct innovation accounting stages. We'll learn about those stages, and we'll learn how to build an innovation dashboard that enables us to fulfill that core feature of an accounting system, providing a consistent set of guidelines and rules that allows us to share progress with others in a form that they will understand.


Next, module two will take us into the transition points that exist between those individual stages, and the process and criteria that we use to make informed decisions about whether or not it's time to move on to the next stage. After that, we're going to go into deep dives of each of the individual stages, and the transitions associated with them.


We're going to start off with the idea stage. This is where everything begins, where we're looking for a fit between the idea that we've come up with and a problem that needs solving. We'll look at how to build a dashboard to keep track of what we're learning in pursuit of that goal.


Next, we're going to move on to the option stage. We're going to take a deep dive into the option mindset, and look at the metrics that you need to measure progress on the way to finding the Holy Grail of product development, product-market fit. We'll end with an updated dashboard that carries you through that stage.


Next, we're going to look at the growth stage. We're going to talk about the particular challenges that we experience in this stage when we're trying to manage high growth that's in sometimes direct tension with the sustainable and scalable business model we seek.


And then lastly, we're going to look at the profit stage. Here is where innovation accounting starts to coalesce directly into traditional accounting. We'll look at the larger context of how we may need to reinvent the product as we bring that cycle back into the company. The goal here is to find idea-company fit, to decide if the new innovation aligns with the company's mission, or if it should be retired in favor of starting the cycle all over again.
Then we'll end with a special bonus video, where I'll talk with Eric Ries about the best ways to convince your company to give innovation accounting a try.




\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




In the last lesson, we talked about accounting in general, why it's needed, how the accounting types change depending on the developmental stage of the product. In this lesson, we're going to outline those stages and the accounting approach that is appropriate for each of them. So let's start by examining the product life cycle itself. This is a common view of the five main stages of the product life cycle, along with the corresponding sales curve in green and the profit curve in red. At the beginning is development.  This is where the idea is formulated, business plans are drawn up, initial funding is secured, and the product itself is created. Obviously there's no sales yet, but we're still spending money, so all the profit is negative, more commonly known as losses.


Next comes the product introduction and launch. We launch the product to the market, and we start to see sales. Of course, launching a product is expensive, and so even though the revenue starts to come in, we see the losses increase.


The third stage is growth. Here the product begins a period of rapid expansion as it gains traction in the marketplace. Losses start high, but narrow as the sales increase, and at some point we become cash flow positive.


The fourth stage is maturity, where sales start to level off, but we have a large and established customer base. Here, the market size reaches its apex, and the product begins to produce significant cash flow.


Finally comes decline, when sales start to contract. Now ideally, product extensions are made that forestall this, but as the profits fall along with the overall sales, at some point the product reaches end of life and is discontinued.


This life cycle is one of those natural laws that we see over and over and over again. Despite the mythos of the founder-hero, no product ever starts off like a Athena leaping from the head of Zeus, fully armored and ready for battle. Instead, it follows a logistic curve, or S-curve, where things start slow, accelerate rapidly, and then finally level off to a steady state.


Here are some sample adoption curves for various products over the past 100 years, which, even including for major events such as the Great Depression and World War II, all share the same basic shape. Now it's also worth noting that the curves themselves are getting steeper and steeper as we get closer to today, meaning that disruption is happening faster than ever before, so it's a good thing that you're taking this course on innovation. But mostly I want you to see and appreciate the same S-curve shape. Things start slow, accelerate rapidly in this hockey stick shape, and eventually level off as the market becomes saturated.


This is the shape of innovation, and we want our innovation accounting system to reflect the logsictic shape of that curve.


Now, the product life cycle is aptly named, because in many ways it mimics the human life cycles. In development, we gestate, fully protected from the outside environment, and then we reach birth, are introduced to the world as babies requiring constant attention and care, but producing nothing but poop for years.


Then we grow rapidly through adolescence, consuming vast resources and food and education and activities, as we figure out what we want to do when we grow up. And then we do grow up, and reach a level of maturity and adulthood for as long a period of productivity as we can manage. Finally, we eventually decline and reach our own end of life, perhaps having our own children along the way to start the cycle all over again.


Now, this analogy helps emphasize two critical points of the product life cycle, and how they directly relate to our accounting regimens. First, each stage is distinctly different from each other, with different needs and different objectives at that point in time. So for instance, infants aren't merely small versions of adults; they dress differently, eat differently, move differently, act differently. They might be human, but share little else in common with their adult progenitors. Adolescents grow seemingly overnight, while adults grow very little, vertically at least.


I could go on, but hopefully I've made my point. If we expect babies to start making money immediately we should not be at all surprised if these expectations are left unfulfilled. The same is true for the product life cycle. 


The second point is that just like our own life cycle, the product life cycle only moves in one direction. Life is a one-way street. We go from child to adolescent to adult in that order. Now sadly, not every one of us makes it to adulthood, although thankfully a lot more than the startup mortality rate of 90 plus percent. But we can never jump back into the womb. The same is true for our products. Once a business moves from one stage to the next, the change is permanent. Now sometimes, these transition points are very obvious and very discrete, like birth, while the boundary of adulthood is less clearly defined and takes place over a longer period of time.  The same is true of the product life cycle.


Here's a few examples of companies in each stage when I recorded this lesson in 2019. An example of company in stage one, the development stage, is, Virgin Galactic. Virgin Galactic is developing vehicles that are designed to take tourists on space flights. The company is engaged in extensive product development and as of 2018, reached sub-orbital trips with their SpaceShipTwo rockets. However, the Virgin Galactic service is still yet to be introduced to the public, and so this is clearly still at stage one. All startups start here.


A company that is currently in stage two, introduction, is Oculus VR. Oculus VR is a division of Facebook that produces virtual reality headsets. First introduced to the market in 2016, Oculus has grown steadily, but despite heavy promotion and marketing, they have yet to reach the explosive growth that typically characterizes products in the next stage. Most startups die here in stage two.


An example of a company that has made it to that explosive growth stage, three, is Bird. Bird is a transportation company whose main product is an electric scooter that can be rented on demand. In a space of just two years, Bird went from nothing to operating hundreds of thousands of scooters in 60 countries, raising 400 million along the way and reaching a 2 billion valuation. Perhaps nothing demonstrates the concept of stage three better than Bird. Most firms that the media characterizes as startups are in this third stage.


On to stage four, maturity, and Google is a great example here. Google, the search product, not the parent company Alphabet, is about a decade into its run as a stage four mature company. It produces cash, a lot of cash, and clearly dominates its market for discovery and targeted online advertising. Now, most companies and brands that we know and associate with are in stage four, the mature stage.


And lastly, stage five: decline. Remember the Blackberry? Now, with the of the RIM 850 in 1999, Blackberry went through incredible growth, and sold nearly 20 million units in the five years that followed. It reached a period of maturity, which peaked in 2014, after which point the Android and iOS platforms began to contract its market. In 2018, unit sales were estimated at less than 400,000, mostly in specialized East Asian markets.


Now obviously, these examples are very tech-focused, and part of that is practical since the tech industry itself is rapid, which means we can see an example from beginning to end -- like Blackberry -- take place entirely within our lifetimes. 


But keep in mind that the product life cycle doesn't just apply to tech or Silicon Valley startups. For example, consider the century-old Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford developed his first vehicle in 1896 out of a coal shed in his backyard, and after some fits and starts, both on the engineering and business side, the Ford Motor Company was incorporated in 1903 and introduced the Model A to the market with modest success. Then things really took off in 1908, when he introduced the Model T. In 1909, 10,000 cars were produced, followed by 70,000 in 1911 and 170,000 in 1912. Things continued to grow, and by 1920, production exceeded one million units a year.


This is what gives the S-curve its name; for the 12 years between 1896 and 1908, the production was measured in the single digits to the low thousands, and during the subsequent 12 years, between 1908 and 1920, it went from 10,000 to one million. That's logistic growth.


Now, the growth almost doubled again by 1923, when 1.8 million units were shipped, but then the Great Depression and World War II impacted production across the entire industry. Still, Ford wouldn't reach 1923's high water mark for another 40 years, until 1965, and from then until today, sales have averaged around that two million mark, plus or minus one million depending on cyclical trends.


But at this point, hyper-growth is neither expected nor demanded. Instead, profitability is key. And for Ford to remain in business, it must remain profitable. The same goes for Coca-Cola, Halliburton, Fidelity, or any other large mature business.


So that's the product life cycle. In the next module, we're going to see how the product life cycle ties directly into our accounting stages.




\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




Now that we have a basic understanding of the product life cycle, let's relate it to innovation accounting. Now, I'm a management consultant, which means that I'm required by law to include at least one two by two matrix in every presentation. So let's do that now, breaking down the life cycle by its growth and profit expectations. 


On the vertical axis, we're going to put our growth expectation, simplified to higher and lower. And on the horizontal axis, we're going to put our profit expectation: again, higher and lower.


Now, higher and lower in this context means as it relates to the prior stage. So we're not talking about any absolute sense of high profit or high growth, but instead higher or lower than what came before. So that's the overall framing. Now, going back to our life cycle curve, where would we put the initial development phase?


Well, that seems fairly straightforward. We're building an unreleased product, so we're going to have neither growth nor profit. So lower growth, lower profit, we'll put that in the bottom left. Next up is the introduction phase. Now obviously, we have a higher expectation of growth, but sales start off slow, and it's going to be really expensive to get things going, so we're going to put this in the higher growth, lower profit quadrant, upper left. Now if we didn't characterize the growth stage as high growth, I think we'd have some explaining to do, but we're also starting to demand higher profits. Even if those profits start off negative, they are becoming less negative, and so we'll clearly put the growth stage in the upper right quadrant, higher growth and higher profits.


Next with maturity, we start to see the growth flatten, but the profit requirements remain higher still, so that fills out the matrix taking the bottom right: lower expectation for growth, higher expectation for profitability. And lastly comes decline, with the lower expectation of growth and lower expectation of profitability, which of course then shares the same characteristics as the development stage which we put in the lower left.


That completes the circle, and gives us the overall picture of the life cycle stages in a very compact form. However, remember that the product life cycle does come from a traditional accounting perspecitve, so I do want to take one final step and rename the quadrants so that they correspond directy to the innovation accounting goals we're trying accomplish in each stage.


Everything starts with and idea, and the first thing we do in Innovation accounting is test our ideas to see if they have merit.  As we'll learn, not every idea should be developed, and so we call our first stage simply the "IDea" stage.


Next, we have the option stage. This is when we take the ideas that passed muster and create the product itself. This is called the option stage because unlike the traditional approach, where the introduction serves as a big-bang launch because growth is assumed, we view this as the opportunity to guage the market demand for our product before making the huge investment.  This gives us the option to move on to the next stage, but only if the response to our product merits that choice.


Next comes the growth stage, where the options that we've decided to pursue are given full investment and finally brought to scale. This is the hockey stick portion of the curve, and it corresponds to the traditional view of growth we see.


And finally, is the profit stage. This is where we take all the stages that came before and start making money. Again, we're still growing here, but the growth has leveled off, and instead, we want to see greater and greater and greater profitability, and we'll never sacrifice that profitability for the sake of the growth.


This gives us the four main stages of any innovation accounting regimen. We start with the idea, which then moves on to options, which themselves will produce growth, and finally leading to profit.


Now we're going to be referring back to this matrix throughout the remainder of the course. If necessary, review this section again so that you have it firmly in mind. 




\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*








In the last section, we defined the four main stages of the innovation life cycle: idea, option, growth and profit. So how does this relate back to our accounting approach? Well, it accomplishes two main goals. 


First, it tells us what expectations we should have at any particular stage in the life cycle. Again, we don't want to treat babies like small versions of adults, so it would be unrealistic to judge the success of our new initiative by immediate profitability. Having each stage named and clearly distinct from one another helps provide us with that set of reliable, comparable, consistent metrics that form the basis of any accounting system.


Second, it shows us what stage is coming next, and demonstrates what those expectations will be. This allows us to figure out the things that will need to take place now in order for us to be successful when we move on to the next stage in the product life cycle. So these two main components, what our set of current expectations are, and the progress that we're making to the next set of expectations, are going to serve the basis of our innovation dashboard. The innovation dashboard is the main tool that we're going to be using to be able to measure our progress. It tells us where we are, where we're going, and how closely we are to achieving that goal of effecting the next transition.


Now in the lessons that follow, we're going to detail the specifics on what goes within each dashboard depending on your particular accounting stage, including some sample key performance indicators or KPIs and how to calculate them.


But for now we're just going to provide you the overall overview of how the dashboard works. First is what I consider the maintenance section, and that reflects the current obligations that you're expected to maintain while in that stage. The maintenance part of the dashboard is meant to show you whether or not you are backsliding in your current obligations. So for instance, when you are in the growth phase, your primary obligation is to produce growth. Yes, eventually you want those growths to turn into profits, but if you start to slide on your growth, then you have a bigger problem because you're going to fall out of your current life stage. So the maintenance section is about measuring your progress for where you are.


The next section is the fitness section. That's where you're monitoring your progress towards the next goal. Now again, this is a secondary objective, but obviously if we want to move from one stage to another, then we want to have some sense of how closely we're progressing towards that next goal. So every innovation accounting dashboard also has to have that section with those metrics, KPIs, and other deliverables that indicate this is how I'm doing on what has to come next. So now that we have our innovation accounting dashboard based on our current expectations and progress towards our future expectations. In the next module, we're going to show how we use the innovation accounting dashboard in order to make smarter decisions about our transition between the stages.


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*


Now we have one final framing lesson and this is the concept of transitions. As mentioned in the lifecycle discussion, the stages proceed in one direction only. No skipping, no going back. And since the way that we account for progress within each stage is different than the prior stage, it implies that we have transition where our KPIs change. Eric Reece calls these pivot or persevere decision points and our innovation accounting process must include that transition process into the overall scheme.


Now, in the last module we introduced the product life cycle, which we use to help clarify the obligations that were expected within each stage. Similarly, to help guide our transition discussion we're going to introduce the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, an equally important concept formulatedf by Everett Rogers in 1962. The technology adoption life cycle focuses on how a new innovation diffuses a population and how a product at a particular stage of adoption attracts one of five distinct customer profiles.


The first customer profile are the Innovators. And apologies, yes, we're using the term innovators and innovation a lot, and I'm sorry for that. Innovators are the first to adopt.  They try something new just because it's new.  They are the smallest group, at 2.5% of the total market.


Innovators are followed by the early adopters. These are the people who are willing to take a chance on a new technology if they believe it will solve a problem that they have, or otherwise can provide them advantage over others. They're about 13.5% of the total population. 


Next, we start to hit the mass market, called the early majority. The early majority are also willing to try something new that they believe can help them, but they're more risk averse than the early adopters and so -- critically -- they must see other people using the product in order to adopt. They're about 34%.


Now, after the early majority comes the late majority, and by the time they get involved, the innovation has already penetrated half of the market. So the problem solving aspects of this are less important to this group than the fact that everyone else is already using it. They're the second half of the main mass market, again, 34%. 


Now the final group are the laggards. They really have no direct motivation. They adopt because they're forced to, and represent the final 16%. 


So to put this in perspective, here are some examples of each adoption profile.  My friend Tom, who is a VC and entrepreneur, is a perfect example of an innovator. He bought Google Glass when it first came out and was enthralled by it. He thought it was the future of wearable technology and wanted to know everything about it.  He had no particular use or need for it, either for work or play; he bought it just because it was new. Glass is a great example of a product that attracted innovators, but few others, and we'll talk more about that later. 


My business school classmate, Ken, purchased a Prius nearly 10 years ago, but he wasn't motivated by hybrid technology or environmental zeal. His concern was far more practical: he commuted a fair distance to work in Los Angeles, which has some of the most notorious freeway traffic in the world, and the Prius would allow him to use the carpooling even though he traveled alone.  So he was willing to take a chance on that new unproved technology, because it solved a very specific problem that he had and as such was one of Prius's early adopters. 


For the early majority, we can use an example from Everett Rogers himself and one that helped him formulate the Diffusion of Innovations theory. Rogers grew up on an Iowa farm where his father grew corn.  During this time new seed strains were being developed that promised better yield, more drought resistance and other benefits as opposed to the more established seed varieties. Rogers' father knew about these innovations, but he was not particularly moved to adopt until a drought year. That's when he noticed his neighbors field was full of corn, while his owncrop had wilted. He switched to hybrid the next season. That's a classic early majority customer. 


The late majority is your mom joining Facebook. Okay, well maybe that was a bit too cheeky, but it's directionally accurate. At a certain point, people who didn't have a clue what Facebook was and certainly didn't see a need for it, were joining it simply because all of their friends and relations were already there. That's certainly why my mother joined and perhaps yours as well.


And the laggards was my grandfather on dial up. And by dial up I don't mean the opposite of broadband, I mean literally a rotary phone that you needed to dial to actually make work. He eventually switched to a touch tone phone, but only because he was forced to by the phone company.


Now the Rogers curve is modeled adoption in widely varying industries from education and farming to communication and entertainment. It's considered one of the most important marketing insights of the past hundred years. 


And just like the product life cycle, we're going to take the technology adoption life cycle and put it into a nice neat little two by two matrix. But this time, instead of using the business objectives of growth and profit as the axes, we're going to use the customer motivations as outlined by Rogers. Specifically, we're going to put the vertical axis as whether or not a customer has a problem that needs solving, yes or no, and the horizontal axis will be whether or not others are using that product, yes or no.


The innovators are the first to adopt. So obviously by definition it's not about others using, and they also don't have any particular problem to solve. For them, it's really simply about the newness of the idea. So we'll put them in the bottom left, no problem to solve and no requirement that others are using it. Next are the early adopters, who do do care about solving a problem but clearly aren't adopting due to others since the market is still small. So we'll put them in the upper left, yes to a problem needing to be solved, but no requirement that others are using it. Next, the early majority still needs a problem solved, but like Rogers' father, they're not going to adopt until others are using it. So we'll put them in the upper right hand quadrant.


By the time we get to late majority, the product is being used by more than half the population, so they may not see it as problem but they certainly see everyone else using it and io they go into the lower right hand quadrant. And ah, the laggards. They really don't care about anything. We put them grumpily and more than a little bit ironically, in the same quadrant as the Google Glass wearing innovators. 


As you've probably guessed by now, this representation of the Rogers diffusion and innovation corresponds to our own innovation stages of idea, option, growth and profit. While the product life cycle tells you what's required now and what's required next, the Rogers curve helps give us that insight so that we can form the basis of the transition criteria, so that we know when it's time to move from stage to stage. Those transitions are what we're going to discuss in the next lesson. 


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




The transitions represent the point where we move from one stage to another. But again, because we can't go backwards once we've made that change, we want to make sure that we don't transition until we have the highest degree of confidence possible that we're going to be successful in the next stage. So what we're going to do now, is put those transition points at each stage in our handy little matrix and name them according to the conditions that we're seeking to achieve, which we call "fitness".


We're not going to discuss any specific fitness criteria at this point; that will come later in the course.  For now, we simply want to name them and provide some indiciation of the conditions they represent.


The first transition point is where we take ideas from the outside and bring them into the organization, which we call idea/company fit. Now that's the transition point that's in the center bottom and it represents the entry point of ideas from the outside that are brought into the innovation cycle. This is simply that we're trying to ensure that whenever we're trying to create fits in the context of the overall company objectives. 


Next is the transition between the idea stage and the options stage, represented by the line on the left center part of the matrixm, which we call problem/solution fit. Here we are trying to show that our idea represents a solution to a problem that early adopter customers have. 


Next on the center line between the option stage and the growth stage, is the big one, product/market fit. Now product market fit is a term you may have heard before, but it basically means that you are producing a product that resonates with a large and growing market. Now this concept goes well beyond innovation accounting, but for our purposes it simply means that you've produced a product that's worth scaling.  


The next transition is on the right center and that's business model fit. This is when you're able to start consistently making money from your growing product, and do so in such a way that makes it a sustainable business model. THis is the ultimate goal of the innovation project life cycle. We want to make to this transition successfully and stay in the profit stage as long as we possibly can. 


Finally we come back full circle to the bottom center and have again, idea company fit -- except this context, it represents the final stage of the product life cycle rather than the start. Here's when you need to decide if the product should be reinvigorated, or abandoned. 


So now that we've named the transitions, we're going to discuss some of the details about the transition process itself.  Now again, I'm not going to go into any detail about the specific transition criteria themselves but instate have a general discussion of the overall transition process, which remains the same regardless of transition.


So first comes: who decides?  Obviously, the innovators should not make their own decisions on their budget.  But if we use a traditional finance reporting structure then we'll be judged by traditional accounting criteria.  So instead, we need to create a new group I call an innovation board. Now those of you familiar with lean startup, the innovation board is nearly identical to a growth board concept developed by  Eric Reece.  However, to avoid the naming confusion with the growth stage itself, I'll be referring to this as an innovation board moving forward. 


The purpose of the innovation board is to guide the innovator through the overall project life cycle, make assessments on fitness for transition, and allocate resources associated with each stage.


Each company can of course formulate their innovation boards as they see fit. But the general guidelines is that we keep the innovation board small, so that they're able to make decisions quickly and can meet on a frequent basis. They also should be in a position that allows them to see the broader perspective of what the company is trying to accomplish in a longer term, rather than on any near-term criteria.  And most importantly, they should not be in charge of existing product lines that fall within their existing domains. 


That last point is critical because, for mature companies with mature product lines, the primary objective is profit. So if you place people in the innovation board whose primary concern is profit, in the best case they will have a difficult time seeing progress through any other lens -- and in a worst case they may actually \*not want\* the innovaiton to succeed since it may disrupt their own product line.


So it really important that you either bring them from outside additional projects or at a different level of the companies that they're able to make a decision based upon the particular project needs and not their own biases


As an example, one of my clients has an innovation board that consists of two individuals. One of them is the CFO of the company, whose job it is to decide between competing resources and allocate the scarce resources of the firm, and the second is the Cheif  innovation officier who oversees all innovation company-wide. 


So that's who decides. But what exactly are they deciding? We use our innovation accounting stages to monitor progress, and our transitions to manage process, but that accounting system is designed for a specific \*financial\* puprose: to allocate the scarce resources of the firm in the most intelligent manner possible. So we've hinted at this allocation of resources up to this point, but now it's time to be very explicit about the concept that we're trying to achieve here, which is called metered funding.


Now again, we use a term coined by Eric Reece for use in lean startup (are you seeing a trend?). But metered funding  means that at any given point in time we only want to provide the resources that are necessary and sufficient for that innovator to achieve their next goal, but no more.  This is reduces the overall riskiness of the investment.  Moreover, the it gives us greater flexibility in responding to external conditions, more fidelity on each individual decision, and ultimately improves our overall chances of success because we can redirect funding as dicated by our market learning.


Metered funding takes its cues from the venture capital model, where investments are tranched and increase in size depending on the immediate goal.  So, the idea stage would correpsond to bootstrapping, or a "friends and family" round.  The option stage reflects a seed or angel investment, while the growth stage relfects a Series A, B or similar growth investment, and the profit stage more traditional financing sources including debt or the capital markets. 


So if we have resources in a given stage, this also means that at some point those resources are depleted.  Thus, every transition point immediately implies the date by which the next transition decision must take place.  So this means that we can and should schedule in advance our next transition. 


Setting the schedule in advance not only gives us the opportunity to be more mindful and planful on our overall resource allocation, it also ties nicely into the overall reporting cadence that typically exists within a larger corporate organizational structure. 


So we now have the who, the what, and the when -- so what about the how do they decide? This is where the transition process ties directly into the innovation accounting dashboards.  Remember, our dashboard has two main components. The maintenance KPIs, which is how are we doing based upon our current expectations for the stage that we are in right now, and our fitness KPIs, which are the expectations that we're seeking next.




So the innovation board first reviews the fitness performance and answers that question first: has the innovator provided enough evidence to proceed to the next stage?  SO if they say, "Yes, you have achieved the fit that you are seeking. You may move on to the next stage. Here are the resources that you need to achieve that next stage (usually an order of magnitude higher than before). and here are the criteria that you're going to be judged by moving forward." So that's the happy path, outcome number 1. 


Now if the answer is "No", then the Board moves on to the maintance KPIs and says, "do we see enough evidence that the current obligations are being maintained?"  If the answer is yes, then the Innovator is granted another period of time and resources roughly equivalent to their current resources, in order to maintain their existing progress and continue to see fitness for the next.  This is the second outcome, and may require an sub-decision to "pivot or perserve".  Now this simple which simply means do we continue in the current direction, or have we've learned something new about the market and we need to pivot to a slightly different approach. In either case, the innovation board is providing the resources for the innovator to be able to give it another shot. 


So that leads the third and final outcome, which is that if the fitness statistics are not good and the maintenance statistics are also not good, then we may need to exit completely.  Now this can take the form of a sale, spinoff or direct abandonment, but the point is that all of our ideas are fundamentally time-bound:  if they no longer meet the basic maintenance requirements, there is no need to pursue them.  


Now again, it's important to understand that this is a natural and totally acceptable part of the innovation process. If we have employed our stages appropriately and metered funding appropriately, these decisions are not as painful as they can be with an NPV approach simply due to the reduced scale and resources involved.  It simply means that we've learned enough about the marketplace to indicate that this is not a good place for us to spend our resources. Giving the firm the opportunity to allocate those resources that would otherwise be lost to something that has a better potential to produce a better return, or be returned to the shareholders.




Now the direct consequence of metered funding -- which is there by design -- is that the innovator is in a race.  It's a race to demonstrate fitness for the next transition, before the maintenance begins to slide.  That decision happens every time you have reached the end of your current resource allocation cycle. And so this gets to the heart of what makes lean startup and innovation accounting fundamentally different than the traditional approach. The traditional approach is ultimately a linear process. We envision our future state and then work backwards through all the things that are necessary to get us there. The lean startup approach and the innovation approach say, "we can't see the future, and so instead view this as an iterative process, where we get multiple opportunities to decide and pivot our tactics as needed to achieve a solution".


So, as a concrete example, this is how an innovation accouting transition process differences from a more traditional gating approach like stage gate:  with a stage gate process, the overall project is broken up into a series of steps, with pre-determined criteria than form a go/no-go decision.  So far, sounds a lot like innovation accounting, right?  


But here's the main difference:  with stage gate, if you don't pass the criteria you don't go on with the project.  The decision dates may be pushed back, but the criteria are not supposed to change -- that's the whole point of having pre-determined criteria, so you don't deviate from the original plan.  


The innovation accounting transition, in contrast, is not only asking the question "should we proceed?", but is also saying "are we doing enough to continue?"  This latter question doesn't bring any pre-set criteria to the table -- it simply is saying, "if we're keeping our current obligations and making progress towards the next goal, then you can keep going as long as necessary to get to the answer".  


That is what the transition process should look like. An innovation board that is deciding based upon data from the innovation dashboard, looking at the fitness KPIs and the maintenance KPIs on a regular schedule. After which point they make a decision on whether or not to make the transition, pivot/persevere, or exit the opportunity. And with that we have the entirety of the innovation accounting process. We start with an assessment of idea company fit that then moves to the idea stage followed by problem solution fit, moving to the option stage, achieving product market fit, moving on to the growth stage, then to business model fit onto the profit stage. Then finally completing the cycle with the review of the idea company fit, again. So we're now going to go into each of those stages and their accompanying transitions into some greater detail. 




\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




The first transition point we're going to explore is again, idea company fit. The purpose of idea company fit, is for the innovation board to make a determination about whether the concept that is being presented by the innovator fits within the strategic objectives of the firm.


So this is perhaps best explained by an extreme example. Say a product manager at Google comes up with the world's greatest idea for a new form of cat food. Now forget about the why for a moment. Just say she does. If she goes to Google innovation board and says, "Hey, cat food 2.0. Here's the pitch." And begins to articulate what is undoubtedly the greatest advancement in the history of cats since Ancient Egypt. Should they accept? Now, change Google to Purina. Does the answer change? 


Admittedly, most of the time this is so clear that the question really never needs to be asked. Still, it's a useful first step so that there's an explicit agreement between the innovation board and the innovator that a particular idea is something that's worthy of pursuit. Moreover, it fulfills the obligation of principal of an accounting system that we have records that are treated in a reliable, consistent, and comparable manner. So that way, future observers can look and see, "Aha, this was a step that was taken." 


The initial idea company fit assessment process should really be as simple and straightforward as possible. Some companies have created extensive software to help them support this while on the other extreme I have a client that works in construction who manages all this on literal pieces of paper. But, it's less about the tools that you use in the process and more about the process itself. Basically, the innovator submits the idea and explains how it fits within the strategic objectives of the company. The innovation board reviews that and then makes a determination on whether or not they agree with the innovators assessment. That's it. That's all that's required. 


And in fact, that's all that should be accepted.  If the innovator tries to provide more, such as market assessments or user surveys, she should be interrupted. And if the board asks for more, like total available market size or revenue projections, it should be corrected. Now this is likely to be the very first conflict between traditional accounting and innovation accounting, so it's worth discussing for a bit. let's remember that the core motivation for an innovation accounting system is to have an approach that can operate effectively in the face of extreme uncertainty, when all of the traditional metrics are at or near zero. So if our concept is a straight forward incremental improvement to an existing product line, then perhaps some NPV calculation, or total available market estimate, or trend analysis is worthwhile. If evidence is available, then it makes perfectly good sense to use those data to make those decisions.


But if we're considering breakthrough innovations that have the potential for nonlinear growth, then we don't have any of that information. We face extreme uncertainty. And so the point is create that evidence from actual experiments that we conduct in the marketplace. We make assumptions, yes, but the purpose is to take those assumptions test them against reality to see if we're right or wrong. That process of turning our assumptions into knowledge is called learning. And so in an innovation accounting context the whole point of the transition is to review the learning that has taken place, and to make a decision based on the available evidence. And this stands in direct contrast to the traditional approach, where we make an assessment based on the quality of the assumptions themselves, rather than on our learning from those assumptions. 


So to persist in guesswork exercises like total available market sizing, unit forecasting, 10-year revenue projections, and so on, are all exactly the wrong thing to do when assessing idea company fit. These again are just assumptions that have no learning, no knowledge, just guesses about the future. All we're really trying to do here, is see if there's a match to the company's strategic objectives.


Now for those who come from a traditional background, this step can be very difficult. There will be a strong, almost overwhelming desire to pick the winners and losers right here and now. And this is often made worse because the innovation board members may encourage this. Not only is there a great desire for certainty even if it's wrong, there's also a great amount of political power that can accrue to the person who gets to make the decision. And remember, in the absence of data, all decisions revert to politics. So removing that aspect of the innovation board's job description will often be met with resistance. So that construction company that I talked about, that manages their innovation accounting process through paper, had just this challenge at the very beginning.


The chief innovation officer whose job it was to help manage and shepherd the product managers through the innovation process, was a former entrepreneur himself. And had the perspective that certain entrepreneurs could see the future better than other entrepreneurs. Now, if your company happens to be the one that has access to a crystal ball, or a time machine or a magic napkin that can always produce the right answers to the new products, then I recommend strongly you use it to go dominate your marketplace. But for the rest of us, we mostly have to deal with a situation where we can't see the future.  And so our goal shouldn't be to hire better fortune tellers but instead to embrace the fully counterintuitive notion, that all ideas are equal until tested. When faced with uncertainty, there are no good ideas or bad ideas, there are only more ideas or fewer ideas.  We want more.  


And that is partly why we want to keep this process as lightweight as possible. Keeping it lightweight will ensure that we're able to handle the potentially large volume of ideas that can come through the process if we're not arbitrarily filtering them in advance. And second, and ultimately more important for the future success of the firm, is that people within the company will feel encouraged to share their ideas without the negative connotations that come from having those ideas rejected out of hand by the annointed orcales.


As we move through into the idea stage, we're going to learn about the processes that we need to set up in place, to actually validate those ideas themselves. But for now, the whole point is to get as many ideas into the funnel as possible. So let's use one more analogy, this time from the human life cycle. The first stage corresponds to the baby growing in the womb, as yet unexposed to the outside world. So the idea company fit analog here, is the answer to the question, "Do you want to have children?" Now you may not have the right partner, or be at the right age, or have the right life circumstance, and so there are all sorts of reasons why you might want to take steps to avoid putting yourself in that position. But the choice to have children is about whether or not they will fit into your life, not about their future income potential.


I can safely say with confidence, that no couple in the history of humanity, ever decided to forego having a child because they forecasted that child's future earning potential and found it wanting. And what the heck? Let's keep going. Once you've decided to have children, it's time to start having sex. So does that mean that we filter out all the possible times to have sex and narrow it down to just once a month? Well, maybe for some, but for most, they have a lot of intercourse. Now sex is free, again for most. And fun. And assuming that you're hoping for the possible outcome that can come from that, you want a lot of it. So keep those ideas coming.




\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




In the last lesson we achieved idea company fit. We took our set of assumptions, which was the idea we were proposing. We judged that based on the available evidence, which is the existing company strategy. And we made a decision based on our learning. It either fits, or it doesn't. And from that we have entered into the idea stage. As with any stage, we have two things that we are looking to examine and primarily report on. The first is our maintenance KPIs: the of current expectations and obligations, and how we are adhering to them. And then second, our fitness KPIs, which are how we're progressing against the next set of expectations.




So, as part of building our innovation accounting dashboard, the first thing that we need to do, is examine our maintenance metrics for the idea stage. Just like the idea company fit process itself is a quick one, this one is a quick one as well. So I don't want to spend too much time on it because again, it seems like it's a self answering question. Most of the time the answer is, "Yes it is." And you just move on. However, there are a couple of examples where this may not necessarily be the case. In one particular example I was working with a large insurance company based out of Boston, Massachusetts. We had set up and were executing in a number of different innovation accounting projects within the framework. And then, during the middle of this engagement, the company was acquired by a competitor. So in that particular instance, we took all the things that we were working on, and we stopped them.  Now this had nothing to do with the validity of the ideas; it simply was because the company strategy had changed.


And this brings up another point of the maintenance testing: just because something worked in the past doesn't mean it will work in the future.  Even if you change nothing in your product, outside conditions over which you have no control can upend a market.  So the purpose of a mainteance test -- sometimes called "regression testing". is to make sure that what you've learned in  in the past remains true in the present.  




Here's another particularly famous example.  On May 26th, 1995, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, sent a memo to = his executive staff that has since become known as the Internet Tidal Wave Memo. I'll let you look up all the details, because it is an absolutely fascinating story. But the short answer is that Bill Gates was looking at the explosion of the internet as a new phenomenon, and the impacts that it was going to have on Microsoft. And in one swoop he directed all of his executives to immediately stop what they were working on, and begin incorporating the internet to every initiative in the company. That is a particularly extreme example, but it does show that if the underlying strategy that is dictating why you are engaging in a particular project changes, then you don't necessarily continue with it on autopilot. First and foremost, when you're in a stage, you need to maintain your existing obligations. And if you cannot, then it's time to either move on, or move out.


So of course when we're in the idea stage, the next thing that we are seeking, is problem solution fit. So the set of metrics that we are tracking, are our fitness metrics that tell us how close are we to achieving that goal of problem solution fit. At its core, the problem solution fit, is meant to answer the question, "Does anybody care about our idea?" In the initial idea company fit, we were simply looking at strategically, did it match with the company's objective? For problem/solution fit, we're taking our idea and we're trying to answer the question, "Does anybody care at all? Does anybody feel that this is a problem that needs a solution?" Some may think that this is an obvious answer, but there are oftentimes products which are technologically advanced, but outstrip their market. Sometimes this can be called by the shorthand of technology in search of a problem. And that's something that we're trying to avoid.


Perhaps the clearest example of this was Webvan, a grocery delivery service that raised nearly a billion dollars of venture capital in the late nineties, but never achieved problem solution fit. This wasn't because grocery delivery wasn't valued, or because the internet wasn't valued, or because the people behind it were dumb. It's just that in the 1990s, no one felt that the lack of online grocery shopping was a problem. Fast forward to today, and we see countless examples of companies that not only do grocery delivery, but food delivery, and dry cleaning delivery, and all sorts of other immediate on demand delivery services.


So problem solution fit, is meant to answer that first initial question of have we articulated our idea in such a way that it attracts the early adopters, who are in search of a problem they need solved? I'm going to give you a specific example of a metric that I use with my clients to be able to track problem solution fit. This is not a required KPI, your organization may come up with a different set of criteria that will be acceptable by the innovation board. But I do want to give you one concrete example of something that works for me. I call this the value proposition score, or VPS. And it is the measure of problem solution fit. It's designed to answer the question, "Does anyone care?"


To get started, you need to configure your idea as a value proposition statement. A value proposition is more than just the idea. It's an articulation of the benefits, and the costs associated with that idea. So if your proposed benefits exceed your proposed costs, then the customer sees value in the proposition and takes the desired action. It's important in doing this, not to interpret the problem portion of the problem solution framing too literally. For instance, it might've been difficult to construe the Facebook's early days at Harvard, as a problem that needed solving. But semantics aside, the main point is that you want to learn how to articulate the value proposition, in such a way that it produces the awareness, interest, and desire to provoke action from the customers. Which is something that Facebook did in spades.


Now for those steeped in the world of established, mature businesses with the traditional accounting approach, this concept can be a little difficult to grasp. How can you gauge whether somebody thinks your product solves a problem without having a product? And while that is certainly one way to do it, it's also more expensive than simply finding out if they're interested in the idea. Because if somebody isn't even interested in the idea, then whether or not you have an actual product is irrelevant. So the clearest example I can provide is that of Kickstarter. 


Kickstarter is an idea funding platform.  Users propose projects, giving a sense of the problem it's trying to solve and the resources they need to make it real. Potential backers then browse those projects, and if they find a value proposition compelling, they can pledge to back the product and get certain advantages like early access or other rewards. 


Now sometimes these proposals include detailed mockups and in some cases even prototypes.  But it's not about selling the products themselves -- it's about articulating the value proposition in such a way that people want to back you.  So measuring Kickstarter support would be a great example of a Problem/soluion fitness KPIs.


But Kickstarter is hardly required.  The simplest VPS is just a conversion rate. So, for instance, a commom tactic used in Lean Startup is to purchase a number of Google Ads that mirror how you would advertise your proposed project.  Then, you take the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions and voila, VPS.  Now someone from a traditional background might say, "but how can you advertise a product that doesn't exist?" or "but what will you do with the people that click?  where do they go?"  These are great questions -- but ultimately they are irrelevant because it is far, far, far more likely that you'll have no clicks at all.  And if you can't get someone to click on an adword, then how will you get them to buy your product?  That's the point of testing Problem Solution fit first.


One thing that's important to do is to have a sense of the threshold that will constitute success, and outline that in advance. For instance, for products where the ultimate value can only be generated by large customer bases, such as advertising based models, for instance. You'll probably need a fairly high VPS, and the ability to reach lots of people. In contrast, for products where the proposed profit per transaction is very high, but the actual number of customers needed can be low, something like electric cars, you might only need a VPS of just above zero.


The VPS should also be measured in a manner similar to the proposed method of eventual sales. For instance, if the product is something that could be purchased online, then using something like ad words as a proxy for your conversion rate, might be acceptable. If it's something more like a medical device that will be targeted and sold to physicians, then perhaps you want to have the target output be a memorandum of understanding. Or similar document that requires a signature, that will mirror the signature required on the purchase order, if that product actually comes to fruition. Regardless, the key is that any evidence must be validated, meaning that the customer must bear a cost in accepting your proposed benefits. The greater the cost born, the higher the validation.


What do I mean by this? Let's go back to our Kickstarter style, presale example. Let's say that you have an idea for a new widget that you expect to sell for 100 dollars. So you put out a waiting list that says, "These are the proposed benefits, are you interested in in this particular widget?" Here are two extremes that will demonstrate differences in validated learning. In one case, you put a description of the product online, and ask people to click the like button if they'd be willing to spend 100 dollars on the product. And in the second case, you put the same description of the product online, and require people to put a full 100 dollars down in advance. The response rate to the second example will obviously be lower than the first, but it's also far more valuable, because the customer had to bare a relatively high cost for the same proposed benefit. The cost is very obvious because it's in the ideal denomination of dollars, but there are other ways to make a potential customer bear a cost.


For instance, asking someone to put an email down to be on the mailing list, is a lower cost. And put in a personal cell phone number, which is lower than the home address, which would be lower than a social security birth date and driver's license number. The point here is not to prescribe a particular benchmark for what to test, but that the value that the customer represents in their privacy, can also represent a store of value for how significant the problem is that you are articulating. The greater the cost born by the customer, the greater the indication that you have a problem that is worth solving.


This is where we'd like to take advantage of some of the tactics that are used in the lean startup approach for demonstrating value, in a pre-product environment. Now going into any great detail about those tactics is a little bit beyond the scope of the innovation accounting course. But if you are interested in how to approach demonstrating a potential problem solution fit through these methods, I encourage you to look up Concierge Testing, otherwise called the Wizard of Oz testing. And tactics such as cafe tests, memorandum of understanding tests, false doors and similar approaches.


But there's one thing that we don't want here, and that's a huge budget. The amount of money required to take the actions necessary in the idea stage should be very small and ideally zero. If you're an individual entrepreneur, this should be out of your own pocket. And if you're a corporation, it should be viewed as a general and administrative type expense. Again, this is not meant to be a direct budgetary line item for that particular idea, based on its merits, because those are currently unknown.




Again, we can't know the merits yet. All that we've decided is that it fits with our strategy. We're still in the low growth, low profit quadrant. We're looking for something that has the potential to grow, and that is something very different from the growth itself. So the innovation board should decide based on the evidence of problem solution fit. If you have a high VPS score, indicating a good conversion rate that aligns to the strategy for what your future product is envisioned to be, then all you need to do is show them that somebody cares.


Because of this, this also generally means that ideas can stay in the idea stage, until they no longer make any sense to the company strategy. So when we come to the transition point and we present our VPS, or other similar fitness statistics, that tell us whether or not it makes sense to proceed. If the innovation board decides that the idea has not achieved problem solution fit, it can stay in that stage as long as it needs to and take as many different inner reforms as it has to, until it actually can articulate the problem in a way that's compelling to a group of users. At some point it may become tiring to constantly recycle the same ideas over, and over, and over again, and constantly say, "No, no, no." But do keep in mind that it wasn't that Webvan had a bad idea, it's just that it had a bad idea for the time. So if they continue to explore the potential for problem solution fit, at some point they might've been able to attract enough early adopters who did see online grocery shopping as something that was worth solving and you want to be around when that happens.


If however, your innovation board is compelled by the evidence that you've provided and believes you have achieved problem solution fit, then it's time to move on to the next stage, the option stage. 


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*




So we've now achieved problem solution fit and so it's time to actually build the first iteration of the product.  But before we dive into the options stage itself, I want to talk a little bit about the option mindset from which the option stage derives its name. Understanding the option mindset is perhaps the most difficult thing to grasp about innovation accounting when you come from an a traditional approach. But it's absolutely critical to developing the appropriate governance structure that aligns with what you're trying to accomplish, during an innovation product life cycle. It's easy to misunderstand that the value that the option provides is different than the value of the ultimate goal. 


Here's a really simple example. Let's say you're planning a dinner party for friends, at a really fancy restaurant that books months in advance. So you make reservations for a particular time and then see if your friends can make it. Now that reservation is an option. You've given yourself the ability to make a transaction in the future, having dinner, while waiting for more information from the market, seeing if your friends can join you. Now, let's say your friends aren't able to make it after all, so you cancel the reservation. Bummer. But here's the question that gets to the heart of the option mindset. Was it a waste of time to make that reservation? After all, you didn't go to dinner. So what was the point? Well, anyone who's trying to get seats at a full restaurant, or tickets to a sold out show, or a seat on an overbooked plane when you just want to get home, will immediately understand that there's value in having the \*ability\* to make the transaction, even if the transaction itself is never made.


Options manage uncertainty,  whether for a dinner reservation, stock transaction, house purchase, or innovation project. We want the ability to wait until we have more information before we actually have to make the transaction, while still preserving the choice to do so. Options serve this purpose. That key concept:  that an option has value, even if it's never exercised, is at the heart of any innovation accounting regimen. 


Under traditional accounting, the decision to proceed is made before any actual knowledge is gained. Yes, great care is taken to build expensive assumptions about what must happen in the future in order to be successful. We call that a business plan, but the knowledge itself, what actually happens as opposed to what assumes will happen, is not available, because nothing yet has taken place. Under conditions of certainty, that's a totally appropriate approach. But when we're facing extreme uncertainty, it's foolhardy.


With innovation accounting, we still have the assumptions, but the goal is not to get better at pitching assumptions, but instead to get better at turning those assumptions into actual knowledge, ie, learning. So the key distinction comes into play, because the result of that learning, the knowledge gained when tested against our assumptions might be, "No. No, we don't want to proceed with this idea." Under the traditional approach, the no result is an indication of failure because the assumptions were used to justify the project's existence in the first place. You're receiving money from finance, because finance assumes the company will get a return from that investment. If the investment was a total loss, how can that be viewed in any other way, other than failure?


But options give us the ability to manage risk in uncertain environments because they give us the opportunity to delay an investment decision, while we gain more information about the market. This is why innovation accounting exists. If we only justify our investments based on the promise of future growth and profit, then any knowledge we gain that runs contrary to those promises will be ignored, rejected, or even misrepresented outright. If instead we base our accounting on the value of the choice itself, the option to proceed, or not to proceed, then we can accept whatever knowledge is gained that the market is giving us. Positive, negative, or otherwise. 


Now, if this still a little bit difficult to grasp, let me use an example that I use in all of my workshops. I will ask the group that may be skeptical about the value of options and how something can have an ROI, even if the project itself has never created, and I ask them, "Do you have life insurance?" And very often, the hands will go up. And then I ask, "How much do you pay for that life insurance?" And generally, the order is on several thousands dollars a year. And then I ask, "Well, what did it pay you last year?" And that's when I get the quizzical looks. They don't understand the question, and I say, "Well, you spent money on it, you made an investment, and it didn't pay you anything back." And then the realization starts to dawn on the audience that, of course, the point of life insurance isn't that you hope to die.


You are not looking for a payout, but what you are trying to do is spend some money that in case this really low frequency but high impact event happens, then you have some resources that will come as a result of that unexpected activity. This is how we think about disruption. Nobody wants their existing product lines to be disrupted but we do have to acknowledge that they happen. So, the money that we spend during the option stage of the innovation accounting life cycle is justified by the fact that this is our profit insurance premium. This is what we're spending so that we can gain information about the market, and reduce our risk in the unlikely event that our existing product lines are disruptive.


Now, when this starts to be introduced into your organization, there will be plenty of times when it can be very difficult to accept. Here's a typical example. I was once working with a large consumer medical company that was having difficulty with their innovation projects. They were experimenting with a new way to deliver medical care online, but were struggling because the product manager seem to be dragging her feet on the project. Now, as I learned, the manager was capable, intelligent, and experienced, and seemed more than willing to make tough decisions. Moreover, they had run a great number of small scale experiments, and had gained a ton of real market knowledge, and very little of this knowledge had been shared outside of the core team. The problem was that nearly all of the evidence supported abandoning the project. The reason for the dragging of feet wasn't a lack of commitment or courage, it was that the answer was no.


When I presented the findings to the general manager of the team, I specifically made the point that the PM running the project was doing a particularly good job. She had run multiple experiments, had a solid methodology, had criteria in advance for determining success, and was reaching the correct conclusion that the project idea was not supported by that information gathered. Rather than sanction her, she should be lauded for the learning that she had done. The GM was not impressed. The exact quote that I remember was, "We are not here to learn. We are here to make money." We danced around this a bit as I did my best to explain the discovery process, the value of choice, the importance of option as a value, but it all fell on deaf ears. 


It was quite literally incomprehensible that I was arguing for the product manager to be rewarded for, quote "Doing nothing." Suffice to say that the PM got the message, found another job, and the replacement dutifully launched the project to huge losses. Now, of course, the original project manager had learned all this already,  but because the accounting regimen of the firm didn't value that learning, she had no way to be successful in bringing that learning to light. So under those circumstances, she was making a smart economic decision: obfuscate and delay as much as possible and hope something changes in the meantime.  Perhaps this sound familiar?


To change these economics, we need to value the option, and the possibility of no which that option obviously implies. If we can make that change, then any information we get -- yes or no -- makes the option more valuable.  This then aligns the corporate goverance structure to our goal of knowing, rather than guessing.  We don't worry about the product manager and general manager in conflict, because they share the goal.  \*That\* is the option mindset, and no innovation accounting approach is complete without it.


Now, if you're wondering how on earth you might be able to convince your company to try this out and avoid the fate of the PM in my story, we've got you covered. At the end of the course, you'll get to hear from Eric Ries himself, who's had that conversation with C-suite executives many times. He's heard every excuse in the book for why they can't do it, and has still convinced them to give it a shot. So, stick around to the end to hear that.


And before we go on, while it's beyond the scope of this particular course, I should mention that I've developed a framework called "Innovation Options" that uses option-pricing theory to perform valuation and risk management analysis for projects in the option stage.  It's particularly useful for CFOs since it allows them to do resource allocation and product portfolio management in actual dollars, so if geeking out with trinomial recombining matrices is your thing, be sure to look me up.  But for now, back to the basics.


\*\*\*




Now that we're in the option stage, it's time to build our first iteration of the product. But before we go much further, I'd like to stress something that differentiates the option stage from the growth stage.  THose who come from a traditional accounting background often equate new product with new marketing.  Generate the best buzz, and you'll win the day. But if that were true, we'd all be wearing Google Glass, riding around on our segways, while talking on our Iridium phones, right?   


Here’s the point:  Not only does extensive marketing distort what you're trying to achieve -- the identification of product market fit -- it will also be seen negatively by the existing organization whose primary responsibility is the protection of current profits and the brands that generate them. You will be seen as a threat to them -- not only as someone polluting the brand, but as a potential threat of replacing them and their job. 


In both cases, you want to protect your own initiative by staying away from the company brand. Remember, the point of a brand is to help scale adoption -- but we're not there yet.  So make sure you come up with your own brand and distribution independent of the parent company.


Back to building the product.  Remember that our goal is to find product/market fit as quickly as possible, and that means we want to build  what's called and again a term coined by Eric Ries, an MVP, minimum viable product. Now, going into what makes an MVP an MVP is beyond the scope of this course, although we do encourage you to familiarize yourself with the concept. But for our purposes, the MVP simply means we want to do the least possible work that still allows us to test our assumptions and build out our dashboard.


As you'll recall, the core dashboard requirements are your maintenance KPIs and your fitness KPIs.  So the first obligation is to maintain Problem Solution fit.  I'm not going to rehash the VPS here, but I'm simply reinforcing that the primary obligation within a given stage is remain in that stage, so be sure you’re continuing to solve a problem for your early adopters.




The secondary KPI is the progress to the Early Majority, which from the Rogers curve means we want to see users adopting as a result of other usage. 


So, the metric that I use to track this progress is what I call the WPS, which stands for WOM/PROM score. It's desgined to track when we've reached the point where existing usage is driving new usage and, so it's the ideal metric to guage product/market fit.


Let's talk about how to calculate it. the WPS is based on the Bass Diffusion model.  Now, the Bass Model, like the product life cycle and technology adoption life cycle, is one of those classic marketing insights of the past century. It was designed in the early '50s by Frank Bass to provide a mathematical formula to model new product  adoption and has been used to accurately model the introduction of color TVs, microwaves, cell phones and even the internet itself.


Now, the Bass equation is made up of two factors. The first is the external effect. This is when people find out about your product through marketing such as advertising. So, an external effect adoption would be, I saw the ad in the television, or I saw an online ad or a outside billboard, or i heard it on the radio and bought the product.That's promotional marketing, which I shorthand as PROM. 


The other way that somebody adopts is from the internal effect. This is when a new user adopts as a consequence of product usage itself, which I short hand as Word-Of-Mouth, or WOM.  Now, word of mouth can be something direct like a friend invite to try a social network, or it can also be something completely indirect like when you see everyone around you wearing white airpod earbuds and decide you want some too.


Now, everybody comes from either internal or external sources, and the relationship between WOM and PROM tells you how strong that potential product market fit is.  Tthe math behind this is very interesting, but a bit beyond the scope of this course.  But just think of it this way:  your first users will always come from external sources. This is true by definition, since there's no one else to refer them. But if you only get users from external sources, then you will never see explosive growth because PROM follows a linear function. You can always do more of it but the marginal effectiveness of each dollar spent remains roughly constant. 


Adoptions from internal sources, in contrast, follow a logistic function. More users mean more adoption, meaning more users, meaning more adoption and so on until it is slowed by saturation. Explosive growth is never guaranteed but if it is ever to take hold, there must be a point where WOM exceeds PROM. That's the tipping point of growth, and that's when you know you have product market fit. 


Now, calculating the WPS is actually quite straight forward. You'd take a particular cohort of users from a defined period of time. Perhaps it's by week or by multiple week, or by month or even by quarter, but whatever that particular period of time is, you take the total number of users that adopted during that period of time, and then you separate them out by the number of people that adopted as a result of WOM versus the number of people that adopted as a result of PROM.


You take the number of people that adopted by WOM, and divide it over the total number of adoptions, both WOM and PROM, and that gives you a consistent index score of zero to one that represents your WOM/PROM score. I tend to view that in terms of percentage, and what I'm looking for is to get close to that WOM/PROM score of 50%. That means that I'm starting to get more people the result of existing usage, and it means that I'm coming close to the tipping point of growth. Now, of course, every company is free to come up with its own metric but the WPS is what I recommend to the innovation boards that are making a determination of whether or not something is coming close to product market fit, and deserves that more significant investment.


Now, the math behind the WPS is very straight forward, but what's harder is making the determination between what constitutes a WOM adoption versus a PROM adoption. Now, this can be really tricky, so let me give you a concrete example of the difference between WOM and PROM adoption. Now, whenever I'm traveling, I always make it a habit to talk to my Uber drivers as a customer development exercise. So, recently, I asked a driver how he started working for Uber, and he said, "Well, I was working for a limousine company for a long time, and then I found out about Uber and figure I'd rather work for myself than work for the taxi cab company. So, I started to try them out, and started driving for Uber." Now, if I had just left it at that, if I didn't take it to the next step, I might have assumed that he found out about Uber through some kind of marketing plan, and I would've assigned him to a PROM adoption.


In fact, when I asked him for more detail, he did tell me that Uber had come to his limo company a number of times, trying to get the drivers to join Uber, offering them promotions and discounts, and other sorts of direct promotional activities that we would [inaudible 01:54:36] with a PROM campaign. But as I kept talking with him, something sounded a little fishy because it was clear that he had only started driving for Uber recently, even though he had known about them for some time. So, when I asked him this, I said, "What finally put you over the edge to decide to drive for Uber?" And that's when he said, "Well, I had a friend who used to work at the same limo company with me, and I hadn't seen him for a while. And then, I saw him at a party, and asked him what he was doing. He said, oh, well, I started working with Uber and it changed my life. I loved it."


That was the point when my driver had decided to leave his limo company, and join Uber. It was actually pure WOM. And again, this is an example of the Rogers' curve in action. This driver was your classic early majority user. He had learned about Uber, it was a direct problem that was addressing what he was doing, but he decided not to adopt until he had one of his friends do it first. So, the WOM/PROM score is your direct reflection of this in action, and that's the goal because it's the kind of product that will generate explosive growth when its WOM exceeds its PROM.


So, I want to give you an example from my own experience, things that are happening now in real time, a tale of two products. Now, both are products that I bought to try to solve problems that I had, a classic early adopter. 


First, I like to cook, but I often found that my vegetables would go bad before I could use them or my bread would get stale. So, I was thinking to myself, "I wonder if somebody has a product that can help me keep my food fresher." So I looked that up, and found something called vacuvita, which was a vacuum chamber that sit on your countertop and keep food fresher.  So, I said, "Great, this is a problem that I have, and I'm going to go buy that product."


Now, here's a second example. I also like craft beer from local breweries, and I'd go down every so often and buy a growler of beer, which is essentially a large 64 oz bottle of beer. These work, but the problem is as once you opened it you lose all of the pressure and the beer tends to go flat, so you would wind up throwing a lot away. So, I was wondering if there was a way that I could preserve my beer for longer and found this product called uKeg.  This was a  pressurized growler, so you go get some craft beer, you fill it up, you pressurize it with their device, and it keeps your beer fresh in the refrigerator for as long as you need.


So both products demonstrated problem/solution fit.  They've articulated a problem, I've looked at their solution, I said, "Okay, I have that problem, I'm willing to try this solution," and I went out, and I purchased both products. Now it's worth noting that the products didn't have to exist for me to have done that -- an adword click would have sufficed -- but I did buy them both and so clearly that action showed there was a  validated desire to solve the problem I had.  (And it's worth noting here that Vacuvita started on Indiegogo and uKeg was a Kickstarter project.)


So problem/solution fit acheived.  Now, what was my actual exprience? Let's start with the Vacuvita. It evacuated all of the air out of the chamber, and the food inside did tend to stay a little bit fresher. However, it didn't suck out all of the moisture, so everything inside would get soggy, particularly my bread. So, sure, the bread wouldn't go stale, but nobody wants to eat soggy bread. So, it was not something that \*actually\* solved the problem.  So I took the Vacuvita off my kitchen counter, put it in my garage, and eventually wound up recycling it. 


Now, the uKeg.  I would take it to my local brewery, fill it up, pressurize the container, and I could have a beer or half a beer anytime I would want over the course of two weeks and it was just as fresh as if I had gotten from the tap. So, since it worked, I continued to use it, and when I would go down to the brewery I would walk in and fill it. 


Now here's the key point:  every time I walk in, someone asks, "Hey, what's that?" So, I tell them.  I tell them I drink beer differently now. I tell it's such a joy to always have a fresh beer. I tell them that it was so awesome that I wouldn't be wasting any money.  And As I would describe the benefits of the uKeg, I could see people literally get out their phones, write themselves notes, and in one case, order the device right then when I was standing in front of them. 


Now, in this context, was WOM me walking in the door and say, "Hey, everybody, look at me, look at me. Buy this cool thing?" No. It was simply a natural consequence of me using the product. But the same thing didn't happen with the Vacuvita because it was in the recycling bin. Remember, the key criterion for hitting the early majortiy is that they must see other people using the product if they're going to adopt.  


Now, what I want to really stress here is that this is not an example of uKeg is good, Vacuvita is bad, because they were still able to demonstrate that there was a problem there that was worth solving. In fact, I still have the problem of food going bad, and bread going stale, and if I found a product that solved that, then I would still be interested in purchasing that. 


My greater point is that while the first step is to demonstrate that someone cares about your problem in the first place through problem solution fit, keep in mind you need to \*actually\* solve the problem if you want to achiveve product market fit.  


So, Vacuvita's challenge would be to establish a customer development process to try to identify what my specific needs were as a customer. Now, customer development is, again, a lean startup term that's outside the scope of the class, but it's basically the process where you're able to identify what the customer needs are that drive the customer usage and then eventually the word of mouth. 


So in this particular instance, if VacuVita were able to identify that my concerns with the device were that the bread got soggy, perhaps they could find another solution that maintains the existing vacuum chamber but then add some sort of desiccation service to it so that it accomplishes both the goal of evacuating the air and evacuating the moisture. Now this may produce different problems or it may not even solve the problem, and there could be a whole host of other reasons, but that is the customer development process so that you can learn what the challenges so that you can address it. 


And that's the example of looking at the maintenace KPIs first.  Just because the VacuVita did not achieve product market fit doesn't mean you give up the idea immediately.  It means  "We haven't achieved the conditions for transition, but if we are still demonstrating that there is a problem here that's worth solving we should iterate on it and make a pivot or persevere decision instead." If it turns out that they were simply wrong, that there was no problem and people don't care about food preservation, then yes, perhaps it's time to exit. But it's still a problem that I have, and if somebody solves it, then there's a potential for that explosive growth.


Now if you do have high enough WOM/PROM score or whatever other tactic you as a firm decide to use as your criterion for achieving product market fit, then your innovation board makes that determination and now it's time to grow. So moving into the product market fit phase is what more closely aligns with the traditional approach of an actual product launch. And that's the growth phase that we're going to talk about next.


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*


So the growth stage is when we have identified and achieved product market fit. This is the opportunity that we have to actually produce your item at scale. And it means that it's the first time that we've actually achieved significant funding and are allowed to use the company brand to be able to scale out the product and talk to distribution partners, company contacts, and basically take advantage of all of the marketing and distribution resources that the company has at its disposal. It's also the most dangerous time for the innovation accounting life cycle because this is really the first opportunity that we have to fail at scale.


Up to this point, we spent little to no money during the idea stage and as little money as possible in ratcheted metered funding increments in the option stage. But here in the growth stage we actually have to go for it, and there was an opportunity that we have for growth that is going to depend on us spending a significant amount of resources to achieve that growth. So if we were wrong with our assessment of product market fit, this is the first opportunity for us to fall down hard. So all of the large scale innovation disasters that we've talked about, Google Glass, Segway, Webvan, Iridian, as well as the internal failures that sometimes persist as living dead within organizations but never really killed because the company is too invested in them. They all come as a result of applying too much funding too soon in the absence of product market fit.


So again, our first responsibility is again to maintain current expectations. At this point we should be growing because we have demonstrated product market fit, and we need to continue that expression of higher growth. So as long as we continue to grow, we'll be fine. But if the growth slips, we either need to be ready to transition, or we need to be ready for the disaster that will fall.


So again, as part of your innovation accounting dashboard, the first thing that we need to do while we're in the growth phase is maintain a strong pulse on our existing growth metrics. Now here we can use traditional metrics for growth because we have achieved that growth, so revenue market share, lift, penetration, quarter over quarter growth. These are all things that we can use traditional metrics for because we have the data. No longer are we at or near zero and forced to use innovation accounting proxies; we can use the actual metrics for our maintenance KPIs here in the same way that we would as if we had done an NPV-funded project.


However, when we look at our fittness KPIs, which means looking towards profitability, then we need to use our innovation accounting approach. Because particularly in the early stage of the growth stage, while we may be starting to decrease our losses indicating to higher profitability, which we expect because we've now entered into the higher profits expectations, we still are not yet fully profitable and are dependent on external investment to support our existing growth. And very often we want to do that because we have the opportunity to increase our growth, which will produce higher profits in the future.


And so there are smart strategic reasons why we may want to continue to grow and accept further losses. This is why a company like Uber or Tesla or other high flyers can show dramatic losses and yet still be extremely valuable. But if the growth starts to stall, then we need to achieve profitability or be in some real trouble. So again, keep on top of your current expectations to demonstrate and do whatever you need to do to continue to provide higher and higher growth. But at the same time, use your innovation accounting principles to track your prospective ability towards moving towards your next stage, which is business model fit.


So this can be a particularly dangerous time because you're trying to accomplish two goals that are often in tension .  Consider pricing: pricing obviously affects growth and pricing inversely.  So if you raise your prices, you gain profit but lose sales; offer a product at a loss and your growth can be exceptional but profits obviuosly aren't. 


So on the one hand, you're maintaining an ongoing concern that must be maintained. There's that strong execution component, organizations, systemization, process, training, all the things that matter to keep your growth engine running. The time for building parts and rearranging components is over. But at the same time, you're trying to build your profit engine where experimentation and exploration are still very much in play. You need to search for the process that will generate that eventual profit for each new customer, clearly identify and validate it, and put it into balance. And you need to take chances knowing that most of these chances will fail.


So how do you do that at the same time, you're running your growth engine at the maximum possible speed? This is the core challenge of the growth stage. But you'll still want to use some of the same tactics that we do with our standard corporate innovation. So for instance, you'll want to protect the brand. Now when you're in the option stage, this is actually fairly straightforward, but now that we've achieved the growth stage and we're using the brand to help promote our growth, the challenge becomes how do you identify profit opportunities and experiment with them at the same time that you're protecting your brand.


Now again, we can look to the lean startup approach to help give us some tactics and techniques to do this effectively such as concierge testing and false doors. But the shortest answer that I can give you for the purposes of this course is to simply say always do right by your customer. So let me give you a very concrete example. When writing the text out for this course, I was using a product called Ulysses, which is a writing application. Now, when I first purchased Ulysses, they were offered as a standard software license: buy it once, use it for life.  But Ulysses found they weren't able to maintain their profitability with that particular model and so they shifted to a subscription model, where now as opposed to paying the 80 dollars to use the software for life, I was paying 40 dollars a year to use the software year after year.


Now this was met with a large amount of resistance from a lot of their existing users, as you might expect. However, Ulysses did make it right by taking the example of the money that we had spent up to that point for the lifetime license, still allowing us to use an older version of the product. But if we switched to the new subscription model being granted three years of the subscription service for free in advance. So they were able to test out and experiment whether or not that subscription would ultimately turn out to be better profitable model for them so that they continue the development on their product, but they did so in such a way that it made their existing customers whole, gave an opportunity for those that did not want to participate in it through an older version of their software. But for all new users would then take into account the subscription model.


I'd like to give another example of a company that had some challenges when moving from the growth to profit phase and how they handled it. And so I'm talking about Twitter, which of course the social media company that experienced hyper-growth through most of its existence. Now about five years ago, Twitter was still not profitable and while they were still growing, their growth started to slow considerably. So at that point they replaced their existing CEO and brought their original founder back to the team under the promise that they will be restored to that hyper-growth that it characterized most of their existence. However, despite their best efforts, Twitter was unable to demonstrate that growth within a time period that investors found acceptable.


And so Twitter stopped trying to search for high growth opportunities and started immediately looking for higher degrees of profitability. They cut or killed even promising new products such as Vine and immediately laid off 10 percent of their workforce, followed by another 10 percent of their workforce six months later. Now after some substantial pain and focus on some of their core advertising products, very recently, within the past few years, Twitter was able to finally achieve general profitability and made the transition into the profit stage.


Now the important thing to recognize here is they made it into the profit stage as a function of their growth being reduced, but sometimes firms are not able to achieve profitability at all despite hyper-growth. An example of this would be the Saturn car company. Saturn was a spinout division from General Motors,   billed as "a different kind of car company, adifferent kind of car".  The whole point of the Saturn approach was to use a novel pricing scheme, no haggle pricing sent into a separate retailer n etwork built out of its own assembly plant and was designed to compete with Japanese imports and transplant in the United States compact car market. Now the first Saturn vehicle rolled off the assembly line in 1990 it was called the Saturn SL2. Three years later, Saturn had delivered it's 500,000th car, and in 1995, five years after the first one ran out, they had delivered their 1 billionth car. Now this is a kind of hyper-growth that hadn't been seen in the vehicle market for some time.


And with that Saturn continued to expand their product line beyond compacts to SUVs, electric vehicles, sport vehicles, and others. However, Saturn's overall profitability fell far short of what was originally expected and particularly in light of the investment that was made in the new processes, plants, designed models, and retailer network system. Then as sales flattened as a result of the economic slow down in the late 2000s, GM eventually announced their desire to close the brand, attempted to sell it to Penske Automotive Group, and when that fell through, simply placed the brand in a defunct state.


So once again, our innovation dashboard, when we're in the growth phase, needs to first and foremost reflect our primary objective. Maintain your existing higher growth expectations. If the growth starts to fall, then you need to be able to be in a position where you achieve profitability and no longer require outside investment to fund your operations. If you are a company like Twitter that can cut your staff and cut products and get to profitability and achieve self-sustainability, wonderful, but you also can turn out to be like Saturn where you're not able to achieve that internal profitability and thus will be subject to sale or closure.


Now the KPI that I use to gauge progress within the growth stage is what I call the MPS or marginal profit score. And this simply measures the degree of profitability on each new customer and the effectiveness of your profit engine. Now this is not a concept that I invented. It's also called the net profit or just profit margin. But basically the point of the MPS is to produce a single metric that's normalized across all of your projects. It's designed to provide the relative degree of your operational profitability. So the basic MPS calculation is you take your revenues, less your expenses, and divide that by our revenue on a per unit basis. So for example, if you made 10 dolars per customer in revenue and the total expenses related to that customer were 5 dollars, then your MPS will be 10 minus five divided by 10, or an MPS of 0.5.


Now keep in mind that unlike the VPS or WPS, the MPS score can often be negative. So for instance, if the total expenses were 20 dollars than the MPS would be 10 minus 40 divided by 10 or negative 3.0. Now in this way, the MPS demonstrates the potential danger of the growth stage. While the MPS can never go above one, there is no lower limit. In fact, if you have the common scenario where there's no revenue at all, then the MPS is completely unbounded. It's literally an undefined number, divide by zero. But of course, as with all our metrics, the mathematics of it is not the difficult part. It's where we choose to put in as those numbers that's difficult.


Now the revenue variable is generally the easier of the two to calculate. We want to calculate the amount of money that comes in as a result of the unit transaction, and using an accrual system for this booked revenue versus actual cash is totally acceptable with the proviso that for the purposes of the MPS, all revenue is assumed to be guaranteed. Now, if you have hold backs, returns or other positions for bad debt, this should be factored into the revenue input. Remember, garbage in, garbage out. These scores are only useful in so far as the inputs that go into them are honest.


Now the expenses variable can be a lot tougher because here you want to calculate all of the operating expenses that were related to that particular unit. So as opposed to gross margin, which just considered the direct production expenses of that customer, sometimes called cost of goods sold or cogs, you want to include all of the expenses that are related to keep the growth engine running, sales, GNA, marketing support, and so on. So as with the VPS and WPS, you also need to pick a particular cohort for the calculation. The simplest is as always to calculate by a particular time period. It might be weekly for consumer focused internet or quarterly for longer sales cycles industries like construction. Regardless, the important part is to maintain the same cohort when comparing the scores.


Now when you're in the growth stage, of course the next goal is to find business model fit and transition into the profit stage. Now you may find a different measure of profitability besides something like the MPS. And in point of fact, when you're project at this point is growing at this scale, you're going to attract the attention of a lot of people probably beyond just your innovation board members, and in fact this may be a time to change the composition of your innovation board. In addition, there are lots of reasons why you may want to forestall profitability because you believe that there's a better opportunity with increased growth. Now for companies that are generating no revenue at all or whose business model depends on third parties such as advertising based model where you're trying to attract users, but then money comes in from advertising sales, then a great deal of experimentation and attempts to find business model fit should be a super high priority for those innovation projects or firms.


However, if in contrast you have an existing model where you can calculate profit and costs on a per unit transaction basis, then you may as a conscious decision want to increase your losses so that you can have an even higher level of growth. And example of this might be a company like Uber that continues to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, but it's expanding internationally under the expectation that it's going to make even greater profits in the future. It's easier for them to make a decision like this since they're existing users are already paying for their transportation rides, and they have a lot more information on which to base those decisions. So in this case, their innovation accounting plays a smaller role because they actually have the data on which to base decisions as opposed to metrics which are at or near zero. But whether forced into because of stalling growth or deliberately entering into because of a desire for immediate returns, then it's time to enter the last stage that we're going to consider, which of course is the profit stage.


Now when we enter the profit stage, this is where the innovation accounting and traditional accounting effectively become indistinguishable from one another. Here our maintenance metric is our main metric, and that is profitability. So here we want to be able to show very traditional metrics such as gross profit, profitability, internal rate of return, return on invested capital, gross margin. These are all the traditional metrics that affect most of the companies that we consider as part of mature firms that have established and well known brands. Now our goal is to stay here as long as we possibly can. Now as we've learned, disruption can happen even with our desired intention to stay here as long as possible. But the point is that we invested a lot of time, effort and energy and money to get to this point of profitability, and here is where we want to stay.


And in that sense this is where we do need to look at our progressive metrics, but not from a desire to progress into the next stage but simply as the point of preparation if we need to because we are facing an existing disruption. Because the next transition of course is into the decline stage. And so we returned to the concept of idea company fit. Now if you remember when we started that was about taking a new idea and matching it to a customer company strategy. But now it's the concept of taking our existing idea, which is still producing profit, and figuring out if it still is going to make sense into the future.


So let me give you two examples of companies that did this and approached it in two different ways. The first is IBM computer. Now IBM produced obviously computers and produced one of the first and most successful laptop computers call the IBM ThinkPad. Now over time as laptop sales began to be commoditized and IBM made a strategic decision to move out of the hardware business and into the services business so they will become primarily a service company. It decided as a matter of corporate strategy that the concept of laptop computers no longer fit within their product cycle. Therefore, they made an idea company fit transition, deciding to sell their laptop business to a Chinese computer manufacturer that was able to better handle the commoditized nature of the market, called Lenovo. And so IBM was better able to focus their attention on energy, on projects that related specifically to their current strategic objectives.


Now another example of this is Netflix. Now Netflix started off as a DVD by mail company, and they went through all of the periods of idea and option and hyper-growth all the way straight through to profitability. Yet at some point Netflix realized that the future was not going to be in DVD production but in online content distribution. And so while they knew that it would have a direct impact on their existing DVD subscription business, Netflix created a new idea company fit project that centered around direct content streaming, which replaced the prior focus on DVDs by mail.


Now, Netflix did not cancel that business. There are still nearly 3 million customers of the DVD by mail service within the United States and as long as it remains profitable, then that service will continue. However, it is clearly no longer the primary focus of Netflix as a company because it no longer fits within their idea company fit. So from a strategic perspective, it's still may make sense to maintain your overall innovation accounting dashboard that allows you to experiment and ask the question constantly revisiting whether or not your product line still has idea company fit, but again, that's a minor concern and may not necessarily be a fit for all organizations. Mostly when you've achieved the profit phase, the innovation part of your job is done. Now it's pure execution and just show me the money.


Conclusion. So I hope that you've enjoyed this overview of the innovation accounting process, and in it we've talked about the main purpose of accounting and how innovation accounting is a facility that we use to help accomplish those innovation goals when all of the typical metrics that we would use are at or near zero. We talked about the product life cycle and how that interacts with the different various accounting stages as the product goes through that life cycle. We've also talked about the technology adoption life cycle and the Rogers curve and how that affects and ties in with the different transitions that happen between the stages. We discussed the infrastructure that needs to support it, including your innovation boards, your maintenance and fitness metrics, metered funding, customer development, MVPs, and similar tactics and techniques that are drawn from and encouraged by the lean startup movement.


We talked about the specific transitions and stages themselves, including idea company fit leading to your ideas stage, followed by problem solution fit and the options stage, on through product market fit and the growth stage, finally leading to business model fit and the profit stage potentially leading back to idea company fit to start the cycle all over again.
