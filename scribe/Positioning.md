> People will buy the book to get something they want.  They only care about what the book will get them.
> Readers learn and remember through stories.  Emotion makes the story powerful — if it connects to the reader and provides them something valuable.
> Facts are important, but people don’t learn through facts.  They don’t engage facts.  They engage through story.

:The reason Four Steps spoke to me is because of the stories in the first chapter.  I wasn’t alone!  Spoke else had experienced the pain and found a way out:

## Objective
### Objective Question #1:  How do you want your book to serve your readers?  What will they get out of it?

My book will serve readers by improving how they innovate.  By providing a corporate governance structure that aligns to the personal and professional goals of corporate innovators, I will give CEOs a way to avoid the innovator’s dilemma and make their companies wildly successful.  I will give them the way to create massive new value, make happier employees, and wildly more satisfied customers while decreasing the risk of irrelevance and disruption.  

### Objective Question #2: Define your future self.  What have you accomplished because of the book that made this effort worthwhile?

I will have raised my profile substantially in the field of breakthrough innovation.  The book will provide the credentials to open new opportunities and will support speaking engagements, media appearances, and put me into a buyer’s market for professional possibilities.  

### Objective Question #3:  What’s the single event that will happen because of the book that will cause you to say “this was all worth it”.  The thing that will make you ‘break out the champagne’ and celebrate.

When I learn that a Fortune 500 company has put my solution into practice, even on just an experimental basis.  

## Audience
`A single group of persons who share the specific problem your book solves.`

### Audience Question #1:  Who is the primary Audience?
The primary audience is the CEOs of the Fortune 500.  

### Audience Question #2:  Who is the secondary audience?
The secondary audience is the product managers, innovation leads, finance professionals and others who are responsible for breakthrough innovation in their firms.

### Audience Question #3: Who’s the person who most needs to read your book?  Describe them.
The person who most needs to read my book is David Taylor.  He is clearly engaging in an extensive innovation program but continues to search in vain for the answer to how these programs should be run.  

### Audience Question #4: What pain is this person experiencing because they have not read your book?
Despite reading The Lean Startup, Blue Ocean Strategy, Crossing the Chasm, The Innovator’s Dilemma and nearly every other book on how to innovate, they still can’t seem to figure out how to make it work consistently within their organization.  They keep sending people to conferences, meeting with ‘experts’, and hiring consultants, but the result is the same:  an innovation success rate less than 10% that is indistinguishable from random chance.  They know that the average age of companies in the S&P 500 has dropped from 35 years to less than 12, and they are fearful that unless they learn out to innovate effectively they’ll be next on the list, but despite doing everything they are supposed to do they still feel that new growth opportunities come more due to luck than planning.

### Audience Question #5: What benefit will this person get from reading your book?
After reading the book, they will think about innovation differently.  They will understand why their inability to create breakthrough innovation is a direct consequence of the systems they have put into place, and they will know how to change those systems to produce different results.  

### Audience Question #6:  What do you want this person to do after they read your book?
I want the CEO to call their Chief Innovation Officer/CFO/CMO and tell her to read the book.  I want them to outline a plan to run the innovation option method as an experiment within their organization and to judge its success by the benchmarks outlined in the text.  I want them to say that this approach is the answer to their innovator’s dilemma.

## The Book Idea

### Book Idea Question #1: In two hundred words or fewer, describe your book.
In this book, six-time entrepreneur David Binetti describes how leaders of forward-thinking companies can dramatically improve their breakthrough innovation programs, leading to massive new growth opportunities and prevent eventual disruption.  David’s approach is as simple in concept as it is revolutionary in practice — breaking through the “Innovator’s Dilemma” that has doomed countless firms to irrelevance in a rapidly changing world.   Through concrete examples, specific steps and yes, even some advanced mathematics, David will provide the step-by-step roadmap to systematize a firm’s innovation and create an entirely new career path for the corporate entrepreneur.   Through this book, you’ll fully understand the true ROI of Innovation and how to make it work for your organization.

### Book Idea Question #2:  What’s the “cocktail party pitch” for the book?
“It takes an option-based approach to innovation that lets us process about 100 times as many ideas as before and has improved our innovation success rate from 5% to 95%.”

> Positioning Statement: My book will attract Fortune 500 CEOs by teaching them how to manage breakthrough innovation through an options-based approach which will lead to my ultimate goal of increased credibility and visibility for my innovation fund.
